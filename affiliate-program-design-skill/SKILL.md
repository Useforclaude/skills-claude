## 1. Affiliate Program Fundamentals

### Why Affiliate Programs Work

**Traditional Marketing vs Affiliate:**
```
Traditional (Pay First):
- Spend $10K on ads
- Hope for sales
- Risk: No guarantee

Affiliate (Pay After):
- Affiliates promote
- Only pay when sale happens
- Risk: Zero upfront cost
- Benefit: Performance-based ROI
```

**Key Statistics:**
```
- 81% of brands use affiliate marketing
- 16% of all e-commerce sales come from affiliates
- Average affiliate program ROI: 12:1 ($12 earned per $1 spent)
- Top affiliates earn $50K-$1M+ annually
```

### Types of Affiliates

**1. Content Creators (Bloggers, YouTubers)**
```
Strength: Detailed reviews, tutorials, comparisons
Traffic: SEO, YouTube search
Best For: Complex products needing explanation
Example: Tech reviewer comparing laptops
```

**2. Coupon/Deal Sites**
```
Strength: High-intent buyers (looking for deals)
Traffic: Search ("brand name + coupon")
Best For: E-commerce, subscription services
Example: RetailMeNot, Honey
```

**3. Influencers (Social Media)**
```
Strength: Trust, engaged audience
Traffic: Instagram, TikTok, YouTube
Best For: Visual products, lifestyle brands
Example: Fitness influencer promoting supplements
```

**4. Email Lists (Newsletter Owners)**
```
Strength: Direct access to inbox
Traffic: Email subscribers
Best For: Info products, courses, SaaS
Example: Newsletter with 50K subscribers promoting tools
```

**5. Review Sites (Comparison Platforms)**
```
Strength: Buying intent (actively researching)
Traffic: Google search
Best For: Software, services, high-ticket items
Example: G2, Capterra, Trustpilot
```

---

## 2. Commission Structure Design

### Commission Models

**1. Percentage Commission (Most Common)**
```
Pay X% of sale price

Examples:
- Physical products: 5-15%
- Digital products: 20-50%
- SaaS/Software: 20-30%
- Info products/Courses: 30-50%
- High-ticket coaching: 10-20%

Pros: Simple, scales with order value
Cons: Low margins on cheap products
```

**2. Flat Fee Per Sale**
```
Pay fixed amount per sale (regardless of order value)

Examples:
- $10 per sale (e-commerce)
- $50 per signup (SaaS trial)
- $200 per lead (B2B)

Pros: Predictable costs, easy to calculate
Cons: Doesn't reward higher-value sales
```

**3. Recurring Commission (Subscription Model)**
```
Pay commission on recurring revenue

Examples:
- 20% lifetime (forever)
- 20% for first 12 months
- 30% first payment, 10% recurring

Pros: Incentivizes affiliates (ongoing income)
Cons: Higher long-term costs

Best For: SaaS, memberships, subscriptions
```

**4. Tiered Commission (Performance-Based)**
```
Higher sales = Higher commission rate

Example:
- 0-10 sales/month: 10%
- 11-50 sales/month: 15%
- 51+ sales/month: 20%

Pros: Motivates top performers
Cons: Complex to manage
```

**5. Hybrid (Flat Fee + Percentage)**
```
Combination of fixed + variable

Example:
- $50 flat + 10% of sale
- Guarantees minimum ($50) but rewards high-value sales

Pros: Attracts affiliates (guaranteed income)
Cons: Higher base cost
```

### Setting Your Commission Rate

**Formula: Work Backwards from Margins**
```
Step 1: Calculate your profit margin
Product price: $100
COGS: $30
Profit margin: $70 (70%)

Step 2: Determine affordable commission
Can afford: 30% ($30) to affiliates
Still profit: $40 per sale

Step 3: Compare to industry
Industry standard: 20-40% for digital products
Your rate: 30% (competitive)

Decision: Offer 30% commission
```

**Competitive Analysis:**
```
Research competitors:
1. Google: "competitor name + affiliate program"
2. Check their affiliate page
3. Note their commission rate
4. Match or beat by 5-10%

Example:
- Competitor A: 20%
- Competitor B: 25%
- Your offer: 30% (most attractive)
```

### Finding Quality Affiliates

**Method #1: Existing Customer Recruitment**

## 5. Tracking & Attribution

### Cookie Duration Strategy

**What is Cookie Duration?**
```
Time window for crediting affiliate after click

Example:
- User clicks affiliate link (cookie set)
- User browses site but doesn't buy
- User returns 15 days later and buys
- If cookie duration = 30 days ‚Üí Affiliate gets credit
- If cookie duration = 7 days ‚Üí Affiliate gets NO credit
```

**Optimal Duration by Product Type:**
```
Low consideration (quick decision):
- Cookie: 7-14 days
- Examples: Cheap products, impulse buys

Medium consideration:
- Cookie: 30 days (industry standard)
- Examples: Software, courses, mid-ticket

High consideration (research phase):
- Cookie: 60-90 days
- Examples: B2B software, expensive products, services

Subscription products:
- Cookie: 30 days for first payment
- Commission: Lifetime or 12 months recurring
```

### Attribution Models

**Last-Click Attribution (Most Common)**
```
Credit goes to LAST affiliate clicked before purchase

Example:
- User clicks Affiliate A's link (Day 1)
- User clicks Affiliate B's link (Day 5)
- User purchases (Day 6)
- Affiliate B gets 100% commission

Pros: Simple, clear
Cons: Unfair to Affiliate A (introduced product)
```

**First-Click Attribution**
```
Credit goes to FIRST affiliate clicked

Example:
- User clicks Affiliate A's link (Day 1)
- User clicks Affiliate B's link (Day 5)
- User purchases (Day 6)
- Affiliate A gets 100% commission

Pros: Rewards discovery
Cons: Affiliate B (closer to sale) gets nothing
```

**Multi-Touch Attribution (Advanced)**
```
Split commission across multiple touchpoints

Example:
- User clicks Affiliate A's link (Day 1)
- User clicks Affiliate B's link (Day 5)
- User purchases (Day 6)
- Affiliate A gets 40% commission
- Affiliate B gets 60% commission

Pros: Fair to all contributors
Cons: Complex to track, requires advanced software
```

### Tracking Best Practices

**Use UTM Parameters**
```
Structure:
https://yoursite.com/?ref=affiliatename&utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=launch

Benefits:
- Track performance by traffic source
- See which platforms convert best
- Optimize affiliate strategies

Tool: Google Analytics (shows all data)
```

**Provide Real-Time Dashboard**
```
Affiliates should see:
- Clicks (today, this week, all-time)
- Conversions (how many sales)
- Earnings (total commissions)
- Top-performing content (which links work best)

Platforms with built-in dashboards:
- Rewardful, Tapfiliate, PartnerStack, Refersion
```

## 8. Fraud Prevention

### Common Affiliate Fraud Tactics

**1. Cookie Stuffing**
```
What: Placing cookies without user consent

Example:
- User visits unrelated website
- Hidden iframe loads your site (sets cookie)
- User later buys directly (affiliate gets credit)
- Affiliate did NOTHING to earn commission

Detection:
- Check conversion rate (too high = suspicious)
- Low time-on-site (instant conversions)
- Geographic mismatch (cookie from US, purchase from China)

Prevention:
- Require actual referral traffic (not just cookie)
- Monitor conversion rates per affiliate
- Use fraud detection tools (Tapfiliate, PartnerStack have this)
```

**2. Trademark Bidding (Paid Search)**
```
What: Affiliate bids on YOUR brand name on Google Ads

Example:
- User searches "YourBrand discount code"
- Affiliate's ad shows up (using your brand name)
- User clicks affiliate link ‚Üí buys
- Affiliate gets commission for stealing your branded traffic

Prevention:
- Prohibit in affiliate terms: "No bidding on brand name keywords"
- Monitor Google Ads (search your brand, see who's bidding)
- Send cease & desist to violators
- Kick them out of program
```

**3. Self-Referral (Buying via Own Link)**
```
What: Affiliate uses own link to get discount

Example:
- Affiliate wants to buy product for personal use
- Uses own affiliate link
- Gets 30% commission = 30% discount

Prevention:
- Prohibit in terms: "No self-referrals"
- Detect: Same email for affiliate account and customer account
- Partial solution: Allow self-referral but at lower rate (10% instead of 30%)
```

**4. Fake Traffic (Bots)**
```
What: Using bots to generate fake clicks

Example:
- Affiliate uses bot service to click link 10,000 times
- Inflates click count (looks active)
- Hope to get featured as "top affiliate" or receive bonuses

Detection:
- Click-to-conversion ratio (100,000 clicks, 0 sales = fake)
- Referrer analysis (all traffic from same IP or suspicious sources)
- User behavior (0-second sessions, no page views)

Prevention:
- Track quality metrics (conversion rate, not just clicks)
- Use Cloudflare or similar (blocks bots)
- Manual review of top affiliates
```

### Fraud Detection Checklist

**Review Monthly:**
```
‚ñ° Affiliates with conversion rate >10% (too high = suspicious)
‚ñ° Affiliates with conversion rate <0.1% (wasting time, cut them)
‚ñ° Same customer email = same affiliate email (self-referral)
‚ñ° Geographic mismatches (cookie from X, purchase from Y)
‚ñ° Brand name keyword bidding (search your brand on Google)
‚ñ° Affiliates with sudden spike in sales (investigate)
‚ñ° Customer complaints about affiliates (spammy tactics)
```
