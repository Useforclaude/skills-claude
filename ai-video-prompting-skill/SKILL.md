## 🎬 Production Workflows

### Text-to-Video Workflow

**Step 1: Concept & Planning**
1. Define video goal (product showcase, storytelling, abstract art)
2. Write shot list with descriptions
3. Identify style references

**Step 2: Craft Initial Prompt**
```
[Shot Type] of [Subject] [Action] in [Environment],
[Camera Movement], [Lighting], [Style], [Mood]
```

Example:
```
Medium shot of barista making latte art, pouring milk into cup, cozy coffee shop with warm lighting,
slow dolly in on cup, soft window light from left, cinematic style, peaceful morning atmosphere
```

**Step 3: Generate & Iterate**
1. Generate first version
2. Analyze what worked / what didn't
3. Adjust prompt:
   - Subject not clear? → More detailed subject description
   - Wrong camera move? → Specify camera movement more clearly
   - Bad lighting? → Add specific lighting terms
   - Morphing issues? → Simplify action, add negative prompts

**Step 4: Refine**
- Generate 3-5 variations with tweaked prompts
- Select best result
- Note successful prompt patterns for future

**Step 5: Extend/Enhance (Platform-Dependent)**
- Runway: Interpolate between clips
- Pika: Extend duration
- Manual: Use video editing to combine clips

---

### Image-to-Video Workflow

**Step 1: Create/Select Source Image**

**Option A: Generate Image (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)**
- Craft detailed image generation prompt
- Important: Character/subject should be centered and clear
- Avoid extreme compositions (works better with balanced framing)

**Option B: Use Photo/Artwork**
- High resolution preferred (1024px+ on longest side)
- Clear subject
- Good lighting in image
- Avoid motion blur in source (unless desired)

**Step 2: Craft Motion Prompt**
```
[Subject Movement], [Camera Movement], [Motion Speed], [Style Consistency]
```

Examples:
```
Subject turns head left and smiles, camera slowly zooms in, smooth motion, maintain photographic style

Camera orbits 90° clockwise around subject, subject remains still, slow smooth motion, keep composition

Subject's hair and clothes blowing in wind, camera static, gentle motion, maintain lighting
```

**Step 3: Platform Selection**

**Best Platforms for Image-to-Video:**
1. **Runway Gen-3** - Most control, highest quality
2. **Pika Labs** - Modify Region for selective animation
3. **Stable Video Diffusion** - Local control, free

**Step 4: Generate with Motion Controls**

**Runway Gen-3:**
- Upload image
- Write motion prompt
- Use Motion Brush to paint areas for movement
- Adjust Camera Control sliders

**Pika:**
- Upload image
- Add prompt describing motion
- Use `-motion` parameter (1-4)
- Modify Region for selective animation

**Step 5: Iterate**
- Too much motion? Lower motion parameter or simplify prompt
- Too static? Increase motion or be more specific about movement
- Morphing? Reduce complexity, add negative prompts
- Wrong direction? Specify direction clearly (left, right, toward camera, etc.)

---

### Multi-Shot Sequence Workflow

**Creating Longer Narratives with Multiple Clips**

**Step 1: Storyboard**
Write shot list:
```
Shot 1: Wide establishing shot - City skyline at sunset
Shot 2: Medium shot - Character walking down street
Shot 3: Close-up - Character's face looking up
Shot 4: POV shot - What character sees (sign/building)
Shot 5: Medium shot - Character smiles and enters building
```

**Step 2: Generate Each Shot Individually**
- Craft specific prompt for each shot
- Generate all shots
- Select best take for each

**Step 3: Consistency Techniques**

**Visual Consistency:**
- Use same style keywords across all prompts
- Match lighting descriptions
- Maintain color palette (e.g., "warm orange and teal grading" in all)

**Character Consistency (Challenging with Current AI):**
- Use Image-to-Video with same reference image
- Describe character identically in each prompt
- Use Runway's Gen-3 with character reference image
- Consider generating character reference first, then I2V for each shot

**Step 4: Post-Production**
- Import clips to video editor (Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, CapCut)
- Arrange in sequence
- Add transitions (cuts, fades, etc.)
- Color grade for consistency
- Add sound design
- Export final video

---

### Product Showcase Workflow

**Goal: Highlight product from multiple angles with professional look**

**Shot 1: Hero Shot (Establishing)**
```

slow 360° orbit camera, studio lighting with soft shadows,
product photography style, clean and professional
```

**Shot 2: Detail Shot**
```
Extreme close-up of [PRODUCT DETAIL - logo, texture, feature],
slow push in, macro lens, shallow depth of field,
dramatic lighting, premium feel
```

**Shot 3: Context/Lifestyle Shot**
```
Medium shot of person using [PRODUCT], [ENVIRONMENT],
natural movement, soft window lighting,
lifestyle photography, relatable and warm
```

**Shot 4: Dynamic Shot**
```

dramatic lighting, high-energy music video style,
exciting and modern
```

**Combine into 30-second product video**

---

## 🚀 Advanced Techniques

### Consistency Across Generations

**Challenge:** AI video models generate different results each time.

**Techniques:**

**1. Seed Control (Platform-Dependent)**
- Runway: Save seed from good generation, reuse
- Stable Video Diffusion: Specify seed in code
- Locks random variation, same prompt = same result

**2. Reference Image Workflow**
- Generate perfect frame as image (Midjourney/DALL-E)
- Use Image-to-Video mode with that reference
- Character/style stays consistent

**3. Detailed Consistent Descriptions**
```
// Define character once, reuse exactly:
CHARACTER: "25-year-old Asian woman, long straight black hair,
red leather jacket, white t-shirt, blue jeans, brown eyes"

// Use in every prompt:
Close-up of [CHARACTER] smiling, ...
Medium shot of [CHARACTER] walking, ...
Wide shot of [CHARACTER] standing, ...
```

**4. Style Lock Techniques**
Include exact same style keywords in every prompt:
```
..., cinematic style, 35mm film aesthetic, warm color grade,
film grain texture, shot on Arri Alexa
```

---

### Controlling Difficult Concepts

**Challenge Areas:**

**1. Text/Logos in Video**
- **Current AI limitation:** Text often warps or is illegible
- **Workaround:** Generate clean shot, add text in post-production
- **Alternative:** Use Image-to-Video with text baked into source image, minimal motion

**2. Specific Brand/Product Details**
- **Issue:** AI may not render exact product accurately
- **Solution:** Use Image-to-Video with actual product photo
- **Technique:** Photograph product, animate with subtle motion (rotation, camera move)

**3. Complex Multi-Character Interactions**
- **Issue:** AI struggles with precise choreography between characters
- **Solution:** Keep interactions simple (hugging, high-five) vs complex (fight choreography)
- **Alternative:** Generate characters separately, composite in post

**4. Lip Sync to Specific Audio**
- **Current limitation:** Most text-to-video doesn't sync lips to speech
- **Workarounds:**
  - HeyGen/D-ID for talking head videos
  - Generate video without speaking, add voiceover
  - Use shots where mouth isn't visible (over-shoulder, distance, etc.)

---

## ❌ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Morphing / Warping

**Symptoms:**
- Subject's face/body distorts unnaturally
- Objects melt or transform mid-clip
- Structural inconsistencies

**Causes:**
- Action too complex
- Too much motion
- Ambiguous subject description

**Fixes:**
1. **Simplify action** - "walking" instead of "dancing backflip"
2. **Reduce motion complexity** - Single action per clip
3. **Be more specific** - Detailed subject description locks appearance
4. **Use Image-to-Video** - Provide clear starting frame
5. **Negative prompts** (Pika) - `-neg "morphing, distortion, warping"`
6. **Shorter duration** - 3s instead of 10s

---

### Issue: Jittery / Unstable Motion

**Symptoms:**
- Camera shakes unexpectedly
- Subject movement stutters
- Frame-to-frame inconsistency

**Causes:**
- Conflicting motion instructions
- AI struggling with motion coherence

**Fixes:**
1. **Specify "smooth"** - "smooth dolly in" vs just "dolly in"
2. **Reduce motion complexity** - Single camera move vs combined
3. **Lower motion parameter** (Pika: `-motion 1` or `2`)
4. **Post-stabilization** - Use warp stabilizer in editing software
5. **Specify stabilization** - "Steadicam smooth" or "locked on tripod"

---

### Issue: Wrong Lighting

**Symptoms:**
- Lighting doesn't match description
- Inconsistent light direction
- Muddy or flat lighting

**Fixes:**
1. **Be extremely specific** - "soft window light from left" not just "good lighting"
2. **Reference time of day** - "golden hour sunset" locks color temp
3. **Specify light quality** - "soft diffused" vs "hard directional"
4. **Include shadows** - "long shadows" or "no shadows"
5. **Color temperature** - "warm 3000K" or "cool 6500K"

---

### Issue: Inconsistent Style Across Shots

**Symptoms:**
- Shot 1 looks cinematic, Shot 2 looks like home video
- Color grading changes between clips
- Aesthetic mismatch

**Fixes:**
1. **Copy-paste style block** - Use identical style keywords in every prompt
   ```
   Style: cinematic, 35mm film, warm color grade, film grain, Arri Alexa
   ```
2. **Lock aspect ratio** - Same dimensions for all shots
3. **Post color grade** - Match all shots in DaVinci Resolve
4. **Reference same films/artists** - "Blade Runner 2049 cinematography" in all prompts

---

### Issue: Subject Not Matching Description

**Symptoms:**
- Character has wrong hair color, clothing, features
- Object doesn't match description

**Fixes:**
1. **More detailed description** - Age, ethnicity, specific features, exact clothing
2. **Use reference image** - Image-to-Video with exact subject
3. **Regenerate multiple times** - Select best match
4. **Character consistency workflow** - Generate character image first, then animate

---

### Issue: Unwanted Elements Appearing

**Symptoms:**
- Extra people/objects in frame
- Background elements not requested
- Artifacts or glitches

**Fixes:**
1. **Negative prompts** (Pika) - `-neg "people, crowds, extra objects"`
2. **Simplify environment** - Minimalist description reduces clutter
3. **Be specific about "only"** - "single person, no one else in frame"
4. **Clean up in post** - Rotoscope/mask out unwanted elements

---

### Issue: Action Not Happening

**Symptoms:**
- Static shot when movement requested
- Subject doesn't perform described action

**Fixes:**
1. **Increase motion parameter** (Pika: `-motion 3` or `4`)
2. **More explicit action** - "actively running forward" vs just "running"
3. **Simpler action** - AI may not understand complex verbs
4. **Motion Brush** (Runway) - Paint specific areas to move
5. **Image-to-Video** - Show action mid-way in source image (running pose, not standing)

```

**2. Layer Your Prompt**
Build prompts in blocks:
```
SUBJECT: [Detailed character/object]
ACTION: [What they're doing]
CAMERA: [Movement and framing]
ENVIRONMENT: [Where and when]
LIGHTING: [Quality and direction]
STYLE: [Aesthetic reference]
MOOD: [Emotional tone]
TECHNICAL: [Optional specs]
```

**3. Use Reference Language**
```
// Instead of generic:
"looks good"

// Use specific references:
"Wes Anderson symmetrical composition"
"Roger Deakins cinematography"
"Blade Runner 2049 lighting"
"Emmanuel Lubezki natural light"
```

### Testing & Iteration

**Scientific Approach:**

**1. Change One Variable at a Time**
```
Base prompt:
"Woman walking in city, camera follows"

Test 1 - Camera angle:
"Woman walking in city, LOW ANGLE camera follows"

Test 2 - Lighting:
"Woman walking in city, camera follows, GOLDEN HOUR"

Test 3 - Style:
"Woman walking in city, camera follows, CINEMATIC STYLE"
```

**2. Keep Prompt Journal**
- Save successful prompts
- Note what worked / what didn't
- Build personal prompt library
- Track patterns across platforms

**3. A/B Testing**
Generate 2 versions simultaneously:
```
Version A: Slow dolly in
Version B: Fast dolly in

Compare results, learn which works better
```

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Request copyrighted characters (Mickey Mouse, specific actors)
- ❌ Expect perfect text rendering
- ❌ Use vague descriptions ("looks cool", "nice lighting")
- ❌ Combine too many actions in one prompt
- ❌ Expect 100% consistency across separate generations
- ❌ Assume first generation will be perfect

**DO:**
- ✅ Be extremely specific and detailed
- ✅ Use cinematography vocabulary
- ✅ Reference time of day for lighting
- ✅ Specify camera movement clearly
- ✅ Keep actions simple and clear
- ✅ Generate multiple variations
- ✅ Use Image-to-Video for consistency
- ✅ Embrace happy accidents (AI may create unexpected beauty)

---

### Rendering & Export Tips

**1. Generation Settings:**
- **Resolution:** Max available for platform
- **Duration:** Shorter clips (3-5s) = better quality than 10s
- **Seed:** Save good seeds for later reuse

**2. Post-Processing Workflow:**
```
AI Video Export →
Upscale (Topaz Video AI to 4K) →
Color Grade (DaVinci Resolve) →
Sound Design (add ambient, music, SFX) →
Final Export (H.264 or ProRes)
```

**3. Batch Processing:**
- Generate multiple variations overnight
- Review all results next day
- Select best, delete rest
- Efficient use of generation credits
