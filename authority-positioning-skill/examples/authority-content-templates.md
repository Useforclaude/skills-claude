[Call to action - what should they do next?]
```

**Example:**
```
I used to think marketing was about being the loudest. Then I spent $500,000 on ads that generated... nothing.

That failure led me down a rabbit hole of consumer psychology research. I studied how people really make decisions (hint: it's not logical). I tested over 1,000 marketing campaigns. I analyzed data from 50,000+ customers.

What I discovered changed everything: Marketing isn't about convincing people. It's about understanding how they already think and speaking to that.

**What I Do Now**

Today, I help B2B SaaS companies turn cold traffic into hot leads using behavioral psychology.

Specifically, I:
‚Ä¢ Design conversion-optimized campaigns based on cognitive science
‚Ä¢ Train marketing teams on psychological persuasion (ethically)
‚Ä¢ Audit existing funnels to find psychological friction points

**By the Numbers**

Over 12 years, I've:
‚úÖ Helped 200+ B2B companies increase conversions (average: +47%)
‚úÖ Trained 5,000+ marketers in behavioral marketing
‚úÖ Generated $100M+ in attributed revenue for clients
‚úÖ Published 500+ articles on marketing psychology

**Credentials & Recognition**

üéì PhD in Consumer Psychology | Stanford University
üèÜ "Top 50 Marketing Innovators" | Marketing Week
üì∞ Featured in: Forbes, Harvard Business Review, Inc., Entrepreneur
üìö Author of: "The Psychology of B2B Buying" (Wiley, 2023)

**My Approach: The Behavioral Conversion Framework**

Most marketers focus on features and benefits. But buyers don't make logical decisions.

My framework identifies 7 psychological drivers in B2B buying and designs campaigns around those drivers. It's based on 15 years of research and testing with over $50M in ad spend.

The result? Campaigns that feel natural to prospects because they align with how humans actually think.

**Let's Connect**

I'm always happy to connect with fellow marketers, B2B founders, and anyone interested in behavioral science.

[Authority reminder - subtle credential mention if natural]
```

**Example:**
```
I wasted $500K on marketing before I learned this one lesson.

Back in 2015, I was running marketing for a B2B SaaS startup. We had a solid product, great team, and $500K in ad budget.

I did what everyone told me to do:
‚Ä¢ Hired a fancy agency
‚Ä¢ Ran ads on every platform
‚Ä¢ Created tons of content
‚Ä¢ Followed "best practices"

Result? 6 months, $500K spent, almost zero qualified leads.

I was about to get fired.

Then I read a research paper about cognitive biases in B2B buying. It said buyers make decisions based on 7 psychological factors, not rational evaluation.

I redesigned our entire funnel around those 7 factors.

Same budget, same platforms, different psychology.

Result: 340% increase in qualified leads in 90 days.

Here's what I learned:

**1. Best practices aren't based on psychology**
Most marketing advice ignores how buyers actually think. Following "best practices" means doing what everyone else does, which means being average.

**2. Small psychological tweaks > big budget increases**
We didn't spend more. We just aligned our messaging with how buyers' brains work. Changing one headline based on loss aversion increased conversions 47%.

**3. Data + psychology = unfair advantage**
Most marketers use data OR intuition. Combining behavioral data with psychological principles is where the magic happens.

That "failure" taught me more than any success. Today, I use this approach with every client.

What's the biggest marketing failure that taught you something valuable?

### Template #15: Twitter/X Authority Thread

```
[Hook tweet - controversial or surprising statement]

[Thread indicator: "A thread üßµ"]

1/ [Context - why this matters]

2/ [Story or example - relatable situation]

3/ [Problem identification]

4/ [Common mistakes people make]

5/ [Your unique insight or approach]

6/ [How to do it right - step 1]

7/ [Step 2]

8/ [Step 3]

9/ [Results you or others have seen]

10/ [Authority credential - naturally woven in]

11/ [Summary - key takeaway]

[Final tweet: "Found this valuable?
‚Ä¢ Retweet the first tweet
‚Ä¢ Follow me @[handle] for more on [topic]
‚Ä¢ Get my free [resource]: [link]"]
```

**Example:**
```
Most "experts" are faking it. Here's how to spot them (and how to become a real one):

A thread üßµ

1/ I spent $100K on fake credentials before I learned this. Could've saved that money and built real authority instead.

2/ There are 2 types of "experts":
- Those who tell you they're experts
- Those who prove they're experts

Only one actually is.

3/ Fake experts do this:
‚Ä¢ Buy fake degrees
‚Ä¢ Inflate results ("helped millions!")
‚Ä¢ Claim "world's #1"
‚Ä¢ Use stock photos as "client testimonials"

4/ Here's the problem: It works... for about 6 months.

Then someone fact-checks. And your entire career is over. Permanently.

5/ Real authority takes longer but lasts forever.

Here's the framework I used to go from unknown to recognized expert in 3 years:

6/ STEP 1: Pick ONE niche

Don't say "marketing expert."
Say "B2B SaaS email marketing for customer retention."

Specific > general.

You can expand later. Own a small pond first.

7/ STEP 2: Create 20 pillar pieces

Write 20 comprehensive guides (2,000+ words each).

These become your "expertise library."

When someone asks "what do you know about X?" ‚Üí send link.

8/ STEP 3: Speak at 20 events

Start local (meetups).
Progress to regional (conferences).
Eventually national (keynotes).

Each talk: Get video. Build speaker reel.

9/ STEP 4: Get 20 media mentions

Use HARO (free).
Respond to 100 queries = 5-10 features.
Do this 4x.

Now you have "As seen in Forbes, Inc., etc."

10/ I did this over 3 years:
‚Ä¢ 0 to 50K followers
‚Ä¢ 0 to $500K/year business
‚Ä¢ 0 to regular Forbes contributor

All without faking anything.

11/ Key insight: Real authority compounds.

Year 1: Slow
Year 2: Steady
Year 3+: Exponential

Fake authority: Fast start, catastrophic end.
