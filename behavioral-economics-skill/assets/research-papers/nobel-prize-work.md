# Nobel Prize Work in Behavioral Economics

## Overview

Two Nobel Prizes in Economic Sciences have been awarded for behavioral economics research:

1. **Daniel Kahneman (2002)**: "for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty"

2. **Richard H. Thaler (2017)**: "for his contributions to behavioural economics"

Note: Amos Tversky would have shared the 2002 prize had he lived (died 1996; Nobel Prize not awarded posthumously).

## Daniel Kahneman - Nobel Prize 2002

### Biography

**Born:** 1934, Tel Aviv, British Mandate for Palestine
**Education:** PhD Psychology, UC Berkeley (1961)
**Institution:** Princeton University (Emeritus)
**Collaborators:** Amos Tversky (1937-1996), primary partnership

### Prize Citation

"For having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty."

### Core Contributions

#### 1. Heuristics and Biases Program (1974-)

**Foundational Paper:**
- Tversky, A., & Kahneman, D. (1974). "Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases." *Science*, 185(4157), 1124-1131.

**Three Major Heuristics:**

**A. Representativeness Heuristic:**
- Judge probability by similarity to prototype
- Ignores base rates (prior probabilities)
- Causes conjunction fallacy

**Classic Example - Linda Problem:**
> Linda is 31, single, outspoken, very bright. Philosophy major, concerned with discrimination and social justice.
>
> Which is more probable?
> 1. Linda is a bank teller
> 2. Linda is a bank teller and active in feminist movement

**Result:** 85% choose (2), violating probability axiom P(A∩B) ≤ P(A)

**Explanation:** (2) seems more "representative" of description, even though logically impossible to be more probable.

**B. Availability Heuristic:**
- Judge frequency/probability by ease of recall
- Vivid, recent, emotional events overweighted
- Media coverage distorts perceptions

**Examples:**
- Airplane crashes overestimated (vivid, memorable)
- Car accidents underestimated (common, less salient)
- Own name frequency overestimated (easier to recall)

**Experimental Evidence:**
- Words starting with 'R' vs 'R' as 3rd letter
- People estimate more words start with 'R'
- Reality: 3rd position more common
- Starting position more available (easier to search)

**C. Anchoring and Adjustment:**
- First number encountered anchors judgment
- Subsequent adjustment insufficient
- Works even with obviously irrelevant anchors

**Famous Experiment:**
1. Spin wheel showing random number (10 or 65)
2. Estimate: % of African countries in UN
3. Results:
   - Wheel 10 → Median estimate: 25%
   - Wheel 65 → Median estimate: 45%
   - Effect persists despite random, irrelevant anchor!

**Impact:**
- Explained systematic judgment errors
- Challenged rational expectations
- Foundation for behavioral economics

---

#### 2. Prospect Theory (1979)

**Foundational Paper:**
- Kahneman, D., & Tversky, A. (1979). "Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk." *Econometrica*, 47(2), 263-291.
- **Citations:** 85,000+ (most cited economics paper)

**Revolutionary Claims:**
1. People evaluate outcomes as gains/losses (not final wealth)
2. Loss aversion: Losses hurt ~2.5x more than equivalent gains
3. Probability weighting: Overweight small probabilities, underweight large
4. Diminishing sensitivity: Marginal value decreases with distance from reference

**Value Function:**
```
v(x) = { x^0.88           if x ≥ 0 (gains)
       { -2.25(-x)^0.88   if x < 0 (losses)
```

**Key Properties:**
- Reference-dependent (v(0) = 0)
- S-shaped (concave for gains, convex for losses)
- Steeper for losses (loss aversion λ ≈ 2.25)

**Predictions Confirmed:**

**1. Fourfold Pattern:**
| Probability | Gains | Losses |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| High | Risk averse | Risk seeking |
| Low | Risk seeking | Risk averse |

**Explains:**
- Insurance (low prob loss, risk averse)
- Lotteries (low prob gain, risk seeking)
- Both irrational in Expected Utility Theory!

**2. Certainty Effect:**
- Reduction from certainty weighted more than from uncertainty
- 100% → 80% feels larger than 50% → 30%

**3. Reflection Effect:**
- Risk preferences reverse for losses vs gains
- Gain: Prefer $3,000 certain over 80% × $4,000
- Loss: Prefer 80% lose $4,000 over lose $3,000 certain

**Impact:**
- Challenged Expected Utility Theory (dominant since 1738!)
- Foundation of behavioral finance
- Applied to insurance, investment, policy
- Explained equity premium puzzle (Benartzi & Thaler)

---

#### 3. Framing Effects (1981-1984)

**Key Papers:**
- Tversky, A., & Kahneman, D. (1981). "The framing of decisions and the psychology of choice." *Science*, 211(4481), 453-458.
- Kahneman, D., & Tversky, A. (1984). "Choices, values, and frames." *American Psychologist*, 39(4), 341-350.

**Asian Disease Problem (Classic):**

**Scenario:** 600 people will die from disease. Choose program:

**Gain Frame:**
- Program A: Save 200 people (certain)
- Program B: 1/3 save 600, 2/3 save 0
- **Result:** 72% choose A (risk averse)

**Loss Frame:**
- Program C: 400 people die (certain)
- Program D: 1/3 nobody dies, 2/3 all 600 die
- **Result:** 78% choose D (risk seeking)

**Key Insight:** A=C and B=D (identical outcomes), but frame reverses preferences!

**Applications:**
- Medical decisions (surgery framed as survival vs mortality)
- Policy communication (jobs saved vs lost)
- Marketing (discount vs surcharge framing)

**Impact:**
- Changed medical informed consent procedures
- Influenced risk communication guidelines
- Legal applications (jury instructions)

**Not prize work, but synthesized lifetime research**

**Two Systems:**

**System 1 (Fast):**
- Automatic, intuitive, effortless
- Pattern recognition
- Emotional
- Heuristics

**System 2 (Slow):**
- Deliberate, analytical, effortful
- Logical reasoning
- Conscious control
- Rare activation

**WYSIATI Principle:**
- "What You See Is All There Is"
- System 1 constructs coherent story from available info
- Ignores absent information
- Causes overconfidence

**Impact:**
- 2M+ copies sold
- Made behavioral economics accessible
- Influenced business, policy, education

### Nobel Lecture: "Maps of Bounded Rationality" (2002)

**Key Themes:**

**1. Bounded Rationality (Herbert Simon):**
- Humans have limited cognitive capacity
- Satisfice (not optimize)
- Use heuristics (mental shortcuts)

**2. Heuristics Trade-off:**
- **Benefits:** Fast, frugal, often accurate
- **Costs:** Systematic biases

**3. Integration with Economics:**
- Psychology → Economics (preferences, beliefs)
- Economics → Psychology (market discipline, learning)

**4. Future Directions:**
- Behavioral finance (asset pricing)
- Neuroeconomics (brain imaging)
- Policy applications (nudges)

**Quote:**
> "The main point of Prospect Theory is not that people are irrational, but that they are human. They are not calculating machines; they use heuristics and are subject to biases."

---

### Impact & Legacy

**Academic:**
- 85,000+ citations for Prospect Theory
- Founded behavioral economics field
- Influenced psychology, economics, finance, law, medicine, public policy

**Policy:**
- Informed consent procedures (medicine)
- Risk communication (environment, health)
- Nudge theory foundation (Thaler & Sunstein)

**Business:**
- Marketing (framing, pricing)
- Finance (behavioral portfolios)
- Product design (defaults, choice architecture)

**Collaboration with Tversky:**
- 20+ year partnership (1969-1996)
- Seamless integration of ideas
- Mutual credit for all work
- Amos died 1996 (would have shared prize)

**Quote on Tversky:**
> "Amos was smarter, much smarter than I am. He was also very quick and very decisive. I was slower and more deliberate. It was a perfect partnership."

## Richard H. Thaler - Nobel Prize 2017

### Biography

**Born:** 1945, East Orange, New Jersey, USA
**Education:** PhD Economics, University of Rochester (1974)
**Institution:** University of Chicago Booth School of Business
**Influences:** Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, Danny Kahneman

### Prize Citation

"For his contributions to behavioural economics"

Specifically:
1. Limited rationality (mental accounting)
2. Social preferences (fairness)
3. Lack of self-control (planner-doer model)

### Core Contributions

#### 1. Mental Accounting (1980s-1990s)

**Foundational Papers:**
- Thaler, R. H. (1980). "Toward a positive theory of consumer choice." *Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization*, 1(1), 39-60.
- Thaler, R. H. (1985). "Mental accounting and consumer choice." *Marketing Science*, 4(3), 199-214.
- Thaler, R. H. (1999). "Mental accounting matters." *Journal of Behavioral Decision Making*, 12(3), 183-206.

**Core Concept:**
People mentally categorize money into separate "accounts" and treat them differently, violating economic principle of fungibility.

**Three Components:**

**A. How Outcomes Are Perceived:**

**Transaction Utility:**
- Acquisition utility: Value - Price
- Transaction utility: Price paid vs Reference price
- Total utility = Acquisition + Transaction

**Beer on Beach Example:**
> Hot beach day, want cold beer. What's max you'd pay?
> - Fancy resort bar: $7 acceptable
> - Rundown grocery: $3.50 acceptable
> - **Same beer, same you!**

**Explanation:** Reference prices differ (resort = $8, grocery = $4), so transaction utility differs.

**B. How Activities Are Evaluated:**

**Hedonic Framing (with Eric Johnson):**
1. **Segregate gains:** Multiple good events > One big (v(x) + v(y) > v(x+y) for gains)
2. **Integrate losses:** One big loss < Multiple small (v(-x-y) > v(-x) + v(-y))
3. **Integrate small loss with large gain:** Net gain feels good
4. **Segregate small gain from large loss:** "Silver lining"

**C. How Accounts Are Categorized:**

**Income Accounts:**
- Regular income (salary): Carefully budgeted
- Windfall (bonus, refund): Spent freely
- "Found money": Most freely spent

**Wealth Accounts (with Hersh Shefrin):**
1. Current income (checking): MPC ≈ 1.0
2. Current assets (savings, home equity): MPC ≈ 0.5
3. Future income (retirement, pension): MPC ≈ 0.1

**Impact:**
- Explained undersaving puzzle (separate accounts)
- Informed pricing strategy (transaction utility)
- Credit card acceptance (increases spending 12-18%)
- Subscription models (payment decoupling)

---

#### 2. Endowment Effect & Loss Aversion (1990)

**Key Paper:**
- Kahneman, D., Knetsch, J. L., & Thaler, R. H. (1990). "Experimental tests of the endowment effect and the Coase theorem." *Journal of Political Economy*, 98(6), 1325-1348.

**Core Finding:**
- Willingness to Accept (WTA) > Willingness to Pay (WTP)
- Ownership increases perceived value
- Ratio: WTA/WTP ≈ 2-3x

**Coffee Mug Experiment:**
1. Group A: Given mug, asked selling price (WTA)
   - Median: $7.12
2. Group B: Not given mug, asked buying price (WTP)
   - Median: $2.87
3. Ratio: 2.5x

**Mechanism:** Loss aversion (losing mug hurts more than gaining mug helps)

**Impact:**
- Challenged Coase theorem assumptions
- Explained status quo bias
- Applied to:
  - Free trials (create endowment)
  - Default options (inertia)
  - Property rights (legal scholarship)

---

#### 3. Fairness in Economic Transactions (1986)

**Key Paper:**
- Kahneman, D., Knetsch, J. L., & Thaler, R. H. (1986). "Fairness as a constraint on profit seeking." *American Economic Review*, 76(4), 728-741.

**Dual Entitlement Principle:**
- Firms entitled to reference profit
- Customers entitled to reference price
- Violations perceived as unfair

**Key Findings:**

**Acceptable:**
- "Price increase due to supplier cost increase" (82% fair)
- "Discount for cash payment" (92% fair)

**Unacceptable:**
- "Price increase for snow shovels after blizzard" (18% fair)
- "Surcharge for credit card" (50% fair)

**Key Insight:** Cost increase → price increase = fair; Demand increase → price increase = unfair

**Impact:**
- Explains sticky prices
- Constraints on dynamic pricing (surge pricing controversy)
- Framing matters: Discount vs surcharge

---

#### 4. Self-Control: Planner-Doer Model (1981)

**Key Paper:**
- Thaler, R. H., & Shefrin, H. M. (1981). "An economic theory of self-control." *Journal of Political Economy*, 89(2), 392-406.

**Model:**
- **Planner:** Long-term interests, patient
- **Doer:** Short-term impulses, impatient
- Internal conflict (like principal-agent problem)

**Predictions:**
- Undersaving (doer wants to spend now)
- Procrastination (doer delays difficult tasks)
- Need for commitment devices (planner constrains doer)

**Applications:**
- Christmas clubs (commitment savings)
- Illiquid retirement accounts (401k early withdrawal penalties)
- Gym memberships (commitment to future exercise)

**Impact:**
- Explained time-inconsistent preferences
- Informed retirement policy
- Template for commitment device design

---

#### 5. Save More Tomorrow (2004)

**Key Paper:**
- Thaler, R. H., & Benartzi, S. (2004). "Save more tomorrow: Using behavioral economics to increase employee saving." *Journal of Political Economy*, 112(S1), S164-S187.

**Program Design:**
1. Employees commit NOW to save MORE LATER
2. Contribution increases coincide with raises
3. Automatic escalation (+1%/year until 15%)
4. Easy opt-out maintained

**Behavioral Insights:**
- **Present bias:** Commit now, pain later (more acceptable)
- **Loss aversion:** No take-home reduction (raises absorbed)
- **Inertia:** Automatic increases (no action needed)
- **Mental accounting:** Raise money = windfall (OK to save)

**Results:**
- Savings rate: 3.5% → 13.6% (over 40 months)
- Retention: 78% stay in program
- Scaled nationally: Pension Protection Act (2006)
- Impact: 40M+ American workers

**Why It Worked:**
- Overcame present bias (future commitment)
- Avoided loss aversion (no pay cut)
- Exploited inertia (automatic)
- Respected autonomy (easy opt-out)

**Impact:**
- Template for commitment devices
- Changed retirement policy worldwide
- Projected to increase retirement savings $300B+ by 2030

**Libertarian Paternalism:**
- Guide choices while preserving freedom
- Design choice architecture for good outcomes
- Easy opt-out (libertarian)
- Helps people achieve own goals (paternalistic)

**NUDGES Framework:**
1. **iNcentives:** Align incentives properly
2. **Understand mappings:** Help people evaluate outcomes
3. **Defaults:** Most powerful nudge
4. **Give feedback:** Information changes behavior
5. **Expect error:** Design for human fallibility
6. **Structure complex choices:** Simplify, categorize, recommend

**Applications:**

**Retirement:**
- Auto-enrollment (60% → 98% participation)
- Default investments (target-date funds)

**Health:**
- Organ donation opt-out (12% → 99%)
