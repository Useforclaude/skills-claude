## Retirement & Savings

### 1. Save More Tomorrow (USA) - National Adoption

**Problem:**
- Median retirement savings: $5,000 at age 55
- 50% of workers have no retirement account
- Present bias prevents saving

**Policy:**
- Pension Protection Act (2006)
- Auto-enrollment in 401(k) plans
- Auto-escalation defaults
- Safe harbor for employers

**Mechanism:**
- Default: Enrolled at 3% contribution
- Automatic 1% annual increase (opt-out available)
- Target-date fund default investment
- Inertia works FOR saving

**Results:**
- Participation: 60% → 93% in auto-enroll plans
- Savings rate: 3.5% → 11.6% average
- Workers affected: 40M+ Americans
- Retirement security: Projected +$300B in savings (2030)

**Behavioral Principles:**
- Default effect (strongest nudge)
- Present bias overcome (commit now, save later)
- Loss aversion avoided (no take-home reduction from raises)
- Simplification (one decision, automatic thereafter)

### 2. UK Pension Auto-Enrollment (2012)

**Problem:**
- 7M workers not saving for retirement
- Opt-in participation: 55%

**Policy:**
- Workplace Pension Reform
- Employers must auto-enroll all eligible workers
- Minimum contribution: 8% (employer + employee)
- Opt-out within 1 month allowed

**Results:**
- Participation: 55% → 88%
- 10M+ new savers
- Opt-out rate: Only 10%
- Estimated £20B in additional annual savings

**International Adoption:**
- New Zealand: KiwiSaver (2007) - 80% participation
- Australia: Superannuation (mandatory)
- Canada: Pooled Registered Pension Plans

**Source:** UK Department for Work and Pensions (2021)

### 3. Saver's Credit Awareness Campaign (USA)

**Problem:**
- Low-income workers eligible for tax credit (up to $1,000)
- 70% unaware of credit
- 5% claim rate despite eligibility

**Intervention:**
- IRS simplified explanation
- Pre-filled tax forms (show eligibility)
- Framing: "Don't leave $1,000 on the table" (loss frame)
- Partnership with H&R Block for outreach

**Results:**
- Awareness: +35%
- Claim rate: 5% → 12%
- Additional tax credits claimed: $2.5B over 3 years

**Behavioral Principles:**
- Loss framing (more powerful than gain)

## Health & Wellness

### 4. Organ Donation - Multiple Country Comparisons

**Opt-In Countries (Explicit Consent):**

**Ethical Debate:**
- Autonomy: Opt-out preserves choice but shifts default
- Family: Can still override (soft paternalism)
- Effectiveness: Saves 1,000+ lives per year per country

## Summary: Policy Impact

### Most Effective Interventions

**By Effect Size:**
1. **Defaults:** 40-90% behavior change (organ donation, retirement)
2. **Social norms:** 5-30% (tax, energy, voting)
3. **Simplification:** 15-40% (FAFSA, tax filing)
4. **Reminders:** 10-25% (medication, jury duty)
5. **Planning prompts:** 5-15% (voting, vaccinations)

### Cost-Effectiveness

**Typical ROI (Government Programs):**
- Tax compliance: 10-30:1
- Energy conservation: 5-10:1
- Healthcare: 3-8:1 (medication adherence, vaccination)
- Education: 5-15:1 (FAFSA, retention programs)

**Comparison to Traditional Policies:**
- Nudges: $0.50-$50 per person
- Subsidies: $100-$1,000 per person
- Regulation: Enforcement costs + compliance burden

### Ethical Considerations

**Libertarian Paternalism:**
- Preserves freedom (easy opt-out)
- Guides toward better outcomes (by people's own standards)
- Transparent (techniques discoverable)

**Concerns:**
- Who decides what's "better"?
- Manipulation vs helping
- Vulnerable populations (less likely to opt-out)

**Best Practices:**
1. Evidence-based (A/B test before scaling)
2. Transparent (disclose techniques)
3. Easy opt-out (preserve autonomy)
4. Regular review (monitor unintended effects)
5. Democratic oversight (elected officials approve)
