## Technology & Software

### 1. Apple - Prestige Pricing & Anchoring

**Strategy:**
- Premium positioning (highest smartphone prices)
- Round number pricing ($999, $1,199, not $998.99)
- Annual price increases (anchoring to higher reference)
- Limited discounts (maintains perceived value)

**Behavioral Principles:**
- **Price-quality inference:** High price signals premium
- **Prestige pricing:** Round numbers suggest luxury
- **Anchoring:** Launch at high price, competitors seem cheaper
- **Scarcity:** Limited initial supply creates urgency

**Results:**
- 20% market share, 80% industry profit
- Average selling price: $900+ (vs Samsung $240)
- Brand value: $263B (2022)

**Why It Works:**
- Veblen goods (higher price → higher demand for status)
- Ecosystem lock-in (switching costs)
- Social signaling (conspicuous consumption)

### 2. Netflix - Decoy Pricing & Simplification

**Current Tiers (2023):**
- Basic: $9.99 (1 screen, SD)
- **Standard: $15.49** (2 screens, HD) ← Decoy target
- Premium: $19.99 (4 screens, 4K)

**Previous Structure:**
- Basic: $7.99
- Standard: $10.99 ← Most chose this
- Premium: $13.99

**Strategy Evolution:**
- Raised all prices 30-50%
- Made Basic less attractive (no HD)
- Standard becomes "good deal" via decoy effect
- Premium for households

**Behavioral Principles:**
- **Decoy effect:** Basic makes Standard look better
- **Framing:** "2 screens + HD" vs "Only 1 screen + SD"
- **Anchoring:** Premium anchors expectations upward
- **Bundling:** Include HD in Standard (integration of features)

**Results:**
- 65% choose Standard (target tier)
- 20% choose Premium (high margin)
- 15% choose Basic
- ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): +40% over 5 years

### 3. Amazon Prime - Bundling & Payment Decoupling

**Pricing:**
- Monthly: $14.99
- Annual: $139 (= $11.58/month, 23% discount)

**Bundled Services:**
- Free 2-day shipping
- Prime Video
- Prime Music
- Prime Reading
- Photo storage
- Exclusive deals

**Strategy:**
- Bundle increases perceived value
- Annual payment decouples cost from usage
- Individual services would cost $30+/month
- Frequent usage reinforces value

**Behavioral Principles:**
- **Bundling:** Obscures individual costs, increases WTP
- **Payment decoupling:** Annual fee → consumption feels free
- **Sunk cost:** Already paid → order more to "get value"
- **Flat-rate bias:** People overestimate usage, choose unlimited

**Results:**
- 200M+ subscribers worldwide
- Prime members spend 2x non-members ($1,400 vs $600/year)
- Retention: 93% renewal rate
- Ecosystem lock-in

**Math:**
- Shipping alone: 50 orders × $6 = $300 value
- Video comparable to Netflix: $180/year
- Music: $120/year
- Total perceived value: $600+ for $139 → "Steal!"

### 4. Spotify - Freemium & Student Discount

**Tiers:**
- Free: Ad-supported, shuffle-only mobile
- Premium Individual: $9.99/month
- **Premium Student: $4.99/month** ← Loss leader
- Premium Duo: $12.99 (2 accounts)
- Premium Family: $14.99 (6 accounts)

**Strategy:**
- Free tier as marketing (400M users)
- Student discount captures lifetime value early
- Family plan exploits household decision-making
- Annual option: $99 (2 months free)

**Behavioral Principles:**
- **Freemium:** Endowment effect (ads become painful after free)
- **Loss framing:** "Remove ads" (not "add premium features")
- **Anchoring:** Family plan ($14.99) makes Individual ($9.99) seem cheap
- **Temporal discounting:** Annual plan (present bias for "free" months)

**Results:**
- 180M paid subscribers (vs 400M free)
- 45% conversion rate among active free users
- Student retention: 70% continue at full price post-graduation
- Family plan: Fastest growing segment (+50% YoY)

### 5. Adobe Creative Cloud - Subscription Lock-In

**Transition (2013):**
- **Before:** Photoshop CS6: $699 one-time
- **After:** Creative Cloud: $52.99/month ($635/year)

**Tiers:**
- Photography: $9.99/month (Lightroom + Photoshop)
- Single App: $20.99/month
- **All Apps: $52.99/month** ← Target
- Student: $19.99/month (70% off)

**Strategy:**
- Forced transition (stopped perpetual licenses)
- Lower initial barrier ($10/mo vs $699 upfront)
- Annual commitment required (early cancellation fee)
- Continuous updates justify subscription

**Behavioral Principles:**
- **Payment decoupling:** Monthly vs upfront (reduces pain)
- **Sunk cost:** Month 3 → already invested, continue
- **Loss aversion:** Cancel = lose access to all projects
- **Anchoring:** All Apps ($52.99) vs Single ($20.99 × 3 = $62.97)

**Results:**
- Revenue: +233% (2013-2020)
- Subscribers: 26M (vs 12M perpetual license users)
- Customer lifetime value: 5x higher
- Piracy reduction: -40% (subscription model harder to crack)

**Controversy:**
- Backlash from professionals (forced subscription)
- But: Adobe revenue proves model works

## Retail & Consumer Goods

### 6. Costco - Loss Leader Pricing

**Strategy:**
- Rotisserie chicken: $4.99 (below cost, lose $40M/year)
- Hot dog + soda: $1.50 (unchanged since 1985!)
- Gasoline: Near cost (2-3% margin vs 15% industry)

**Behavioral Principles:**
- **Anchoring:** Low prices on known items → perceive everything as cheap
- **Reciprocity:** Great deals → buy more in store
- **Mental accounting:** "Saved $5 on chicken" → spend $50 on impulse

**Results:**
- Membership renewals: 90% (loyalty)
- Average transaction: $150+ (vs $50 Target)
- Gasoline drives visits: 60% fill up when shopping
- Chicken sales: 100M/year (foot traffic driver)

**Why It Works:**
- Chicken loss subsidized by:
  - $60 membership fee × 120M members = $7.2B
  - High-margin items (apparel, electronics)
  - Bulk purchases (larger baskets)

---

**Pricing:**
- Below competitors (15-30% cheaper)
- No "sales" or loyalty cards (everyday low price)
- Round numbers ($3.99, $4.99)

**Behavioral Principles:**
- **Choice overload reduction:** 4,000 < 40,000 (easier decisions)
- **Curated selection:** Trust in store's choices
- **Scarcity:** Limited SKUs → "better try it now"
- **Framing:** Private label as premium ("Trader Joe's brand")

**Results:**
- Sales per sq ft: $2,000 (vs $600 typical)
- Customer satisfaction: Highest in grocery industry
- Cult following (social proof)

- Small stores (exclusive feeling)

**Behavioral Principles:**

**Size Strategy:**
- Tall (12oz): $3.45
- Grande (16oz): $3.95 ← Target
- Venti (20oz): $4.45 ← Anchor

**Why Venti Exists:**

- Venti makes Grande seem reasonable
- Tall seems "cheap" (low quality signal)

**Additional Tactics:**

- Large highest profit margin (popcorn cost: $0.50)
