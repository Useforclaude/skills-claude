# Archetype Combinations: Creating Brand Depth

## Why Combine Archetypes?

**Single archetype limitations:**
- Can feel one-dimensional
- May alienate portions of audience
- Limits flexibility
- Predictable

**Combination benefits:**
- Adds complexity and nuance
- Appeals to broader audience
- Creates unique positioning
- Allows strategic flexibility

**The 70/30 Rule:**
- Primary archetype: 70-80% of brand expression
- Secondary archetype: 20-30% supporting role
- Occasional tertiary: <10% for specific contexts

## Archetype Combination Decision Matrix

### Step 1: Identify Primary Archetype
**Ask:** What is our core brand essence? (Choose ONE)

### Step 2: Test for Secondary Need
**Ask:**
- Does primary feel too limiting?
- Are we missing part of our audience?
- Do we need strategic flexibility?

If YES to 2+, add secondary archetype.

### Step 3: Select Compatible Secondary
**Check compatibility:**
1. Do motivations align or complement?
2. Can we authentically embody both?
3. Does it create unique positioning?
4. Can we maintain it consistently?

### Step 4: Define Expression Ratio
**Decide:**
- Primary: 70-80%
- Secondary: 20-30%
- Document where each appears

### Step 5: Create Guidelines
**Specify:**
- When to emphasize primary
- When to bring in secondary
- What combinations to avoid
- How to balance both

7. Maintain consistency

**Remember:**

- Authenticity beats complexity

**The goal:** Create unique, ownable brand personality that resonates deeply with your audience while differentiating from competitors.
