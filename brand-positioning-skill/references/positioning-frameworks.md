## 1. Ries & Trout: The Original Positioning Framework {#ries-trout}

### Background

Al Ries and Jack Trout introduced "positioning" in their 1981 book "Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind." This framework revolutionized marketing by shifting focus from products to perception.

### Core Philosophy

**"Positioning is not what you do to a product. Positioning is what you do to the mind of the prospect."**

### The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing

#### Law 1: The Law of Leadership
**"It's better to be first than it is to be better."**

**Principle:**
- First brand in a category typically maintains leadership
- First in mind > first in marketplace
- Leadership creates perception of superiority

**Examples:**
- Coca-Cola (first cola) - dominant for 100+ years
- Xerox (first photocopier) - name became verb
- Google (first quality search) - 92%+ market share
- Uber (first ride-sharing app) - defined category

**Application:**
- If you can't be first in category, create new category
- Move fast when pioneering new space
- Document and communicate "first" status
- Protect leadership position aggressively

**Mistakes:**
- Being first in marketplace but not first in mind
- Letting competitor claim "first" perception
- Failing to maintain leadership position

---

#### Law 2: The Law of the Category
**"If you can't be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in."**

**Principle:**
- When you can't lead existing category, create new one
- Be first in mind = own category
- Create category name and definition

**Examples:**
- **Dell:** Couldn't beat IBM/Compaq in computer stores → created "direct-sale computers" category
- **Red Bull:** Couldn't beat Coke/Pepsi in cola → created "energy drink" category
- **Netflix:** Couldn't beat Blockbuster in video rental → created "streaming entertainment" category
- **Airbnb:** Couldn't beat hotels → created "home sharing" category

**How to Apply:**

**Step 1: Identify Unwinnable Category**
- Assess market leadership
- Evaluate your competitive position
- Determine if you can realistically win

**Step 2: Define New Category**
- What's different about your approach?
- What problem do you solve differently?
- What's the new category name?

**Step 3: Communicate Category**
- Educate market on new category
- Explain why it matters
- Position yourself as category founder

**Step 4: Defend Category Leadership**
- Evangelize category (not just brand)
- Set category standards
- Make brand synonymous with category

**Category Naming Guidelines:**
- Descriptive but distinctive
- Easy to understand
- Forward-looking
- Ownable (not too generic)

---

#### Law 3: The Law of the Mind
**"It's better to be first in the mind than to be first in the marketplace."**

**Principle:**
- Mental positioning trumps chronological first
- Perception > reality
- Hard to change established perceptions

**Examples:**
- **IBM PC:** Not first PC (Apple, Commodore were first), but first in business minds
- **Oreo:** Not first sandwich cookie (Hydrox was first, 1908), but owns category in mind
- **Gillette:** Not first safety razor, but first in mind = 70%+ market share

**Strategies to Be First in Mind:**

**1. Marketing Investment at Launch**
- Heavy initial spend to capture mindshare
- First impression is lasting impression

**2. Simplicity and Clarity**
- Simple message sticks
- Complex messages forgotten

**3. Repetition**
- Consistent messaging over time
- Don't change positioning frequently

**4. Emotional Connection**
- Emotional memories stronger than rational
- Create emotional associations

**5. Distinctive Assets**
- Unique visuals/sounds/language
- Mental availability through cues

**How to Measure "First in Mind":**

**Unaided Awareness Survey:**
```
"When I say [category], what brand comes to mind first?"

Results:
- Brand A: 45% (first in mind)
- Brand B: 25%
- Brand C: 15%
- Other: 15%
```

**Top-of-Mind Awareness (TOMA):**
- % mentioning your brand first
- Target: 30%+ for leadership
- Track over time

---

#### Law 4: The Law of Perception
**"Marketing is not a battle of products, it's a battle of perceptions."**

**Principle:**
- There are no best products, only perceptions of "best"
- Truth is irrelevant; perception is truth
- Perception shaped by marketing, not product alone

**Famous Examples:**

**1. Pepsi Challenge**
- Blind taste tests: Pepsi won
- Open taste tests: Coke won
- Proof: Brand perception affects taste perception

**2. Wine Studies**
- Same wine, different price labels
- Higher price → rated better taste
- Price creates quality perception

**3. Corona Beer**
- Clear bottle (usually a flaw - causes skunk flavor)
- Turned into unique differentiator
- Perception: Premium, authentic Mexican beer

**Implications for Positioning:**

**1. Manage Perception, Not Just Product**
- Product quality necessary but not sufficient
- Perception = reality in customer mind
- Control narrative through positioning

**2. Price Affects Quality Perception**
- Premium price → quality perception
- Discounting → cheapens perception
- Price is a positioning signal

**3. Packaging and Presentation Matter**
- Visual cues create perception
- Design communicates positioning
- Details matter (fonts, colors, materials)

**4. Associations Transfer**
- Celebrity endorsements transfer associations
- Partner brands influence perception
- Context creates meaning

**Perception Management Tactics:**

**Tactic 1: Third-Party Validation**
- Awards and certifications
- Expert endorsements
- Media coverage
- Customer testimonials

**Tactic 2: Strategic Pricing**
- Price to desired perception
- Avoid discounting if premium positioned
- Bundle to increase perceived value

**Tactic 3: Distinctive Brand Assets**
- Unique colors (Tiffany blue, Coca-Cola red)
- Signature sounds (Intel chime, HBO static)
- Iconic shapes (Coca-Cola bottle, Apple logo)

**Tactic 4: Storytelling**
- Origin stories create authenticity
- Values and mission shape perception
- Narrative drives emotional connection

---

#### Law 5: The Law of Focus
**"The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect's mind."**

**Principle:**
- Own one word = strongest positioning
- Trying to own multiple words = weak positioning
- Word should be simple, memorable, owned

**Examples of Word Ownership:**

| Brand | Owned Word | How They Own It |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Volvo | Safety | 50+ years of safety innovations, messaging |
| FedEx | Overnight | "When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight" |
| BMW | Driving | "The Ultimate Driving Machine" |
| Walmart | Low Prices | "Everyday Low Prices" |
| Disney | Magic | "The Magic Kingdom," magical experiences |
| Patagonia | Environmental | 1% for Planet, environmental activism |
| Apple | Innovation | Continuous product innovation, "Think Different" |
| Zappos | Service | Legendary customer service, free returns |

**How to Find Your Word:**

**Step 1: Category Analysis**
- What words are already owned in your category?
- What words are available?
- What matters to customers?

**Step 2: Competitive Audit**
- What does each competitor own?
- What's unowned?
- What can you credibly claim?

**Step 3: Internal Capability Assessment**
- What are we genuinely best at?
- What can we consistently deliver?
- What aligns with our strengths?

**Step 4: Customer Research**
- What do customers associate with us?
- What word would they use?
- Does it match what we want to own?

**Step 5: Selection Criteria**

**Good Word Characteristics:**
- **Relevant:** Matters to target customers
- **Differentiated:** Not owned by competitors
- **Credible:** You can deliver on it
- **Simple:** One word (or very short phrase)
- **Memorable:** Easy to remember
- **Sustainable:** Can own it long-term

**Step 6: Commitment**
- Choose one word
- Commit for 5+ years
- Integrate into all messaging
- Resist temptation to change

**Common Mistakes:**

❌ **Choosing generic words**
- "Quality" - everyone claims it
- "Innovative" - overused
- "Customer-focused" - meaningless

❌ **Trying to own multiple words**
- Confuses positioning
- Dilutes focus
- Weakens both

❌ **Choosing words you can't own**
- Competitor already owns it
- You can't deliver on it
- Inconsistent with brand history

✅ **Best Practices:**

1. **Own Opposite of Leader**
   - If leader owns "established," own "innovative"
   - If leader owns "comprehensive," own "simple"

2. **Own Emerging Attribute**
   - Anticipate what will matter
   - Claim it before others

3. **Own Emotion, Not Just Function**
   - "Excitement" more powerful than "fast"
   - "Confidence" more powerful than "effective"

**Defending Your Word:**

Once you own a word, defend it:

1. **Consistent Messaging**
   - Every campaign reinforces the word
   - Never contradict it

2. **Product Development**
   - New products support the word
   - R&D focused on strengthening position

3. **Proof Points**
   - Continuously demonstrate ownership
   - Awards, certifications, testimonials

4. **Legal Protection**
   - Trademark slogans
   - Defend against encroachment
   - Monitor competitors

---

#### Law 6: The Law of Exclusivity
**"Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect's mind."**

**Principle:**
- Once competitor owns a word, futile to try owning same word
- Find different word or attribute
- Copying positioning always fails

**Famous Failures:**

**1. Burger King vs. McDonald's "Fast"**
- McDonald's owned "fast food"
- Burger King tried to compete on speed
- Failed; switched to "Have It Your Way" (customization)

**2. Avis vs. Hertz "Biggest"**
- Hertz owned "biggest" (#1 car rental)
- Avis tried to compete on size
- Failed; switched to "We Try Harder" (#2 position)

**3. Pepsi vs. Coke "Original Cola"**
- Coke owned "original" and "authentic"
- Pepsi tried "Real Cola"
- Failed; switched to "Pepsi Generation" (youth)

**Alternative Strategies:**

**Strategy 1: Own the Opposite**
- Leader owns "established" → You own "innovative"
- Leader owns "comprehensive" → You own "simple"
- Leader owns "premium" → You own "accessible"

**Strategy 2: Own Related Attribute**
- Leader owns "safe" → You own "reliable"
- Leader owns "fast" → You own "convenient"
- Different but related benefit

**Strategy 3: Own Subcategory**
- Leader owns category → You own subcategory
- Coca-Cola owns "cola" → Diet Coke owns "diet cola"
- Create new category with new word

**Strategy 4: Own Different Benefit for Different Audience**
- Leader owns "enterprise" → You own "small business"
- Same product, different positioning for different audience

**How to Identify Available Words:**

**Step 1: Competitive Word Audit**

Create matrix:

| Competitor | Owned Word | Strength of Ownership |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| Leader | [Word] | Strong |
| #2 | [Word] | Medium |
| #3 | [Word] | Weak |

**Step 2: Customer Attribute Importance**

Survey customers:

"Rate importance (1-10) of these attributes when choosing [category]:"
- Price
- Quality
- Speed
- Service
- Innovation
- Simplicity
- [etc.]

**Step 3: Opportunity Matrix**

```
              High Customer Importance
                        |
                        |
    Available Words     |    Owned by Competitors
    (OPPORTUNITY!)      |    (AVOID!)
                        |
------------------------+------------------------
                        |
    Available Words     |    Owned by Competitors
    (LOW PRIORITY)      |    (AVOID!)
                        |
              Low Customer Importance
```

**Step 4: Select Available High-Importance Word**

Choose word that is:
- High importance to customers
- Not owned by strong competitor
- Aligned with your capabilities

---

#### Law 7: The Law of the Ladder
**"The strategy to use depends on which rung you occupy on the ladder."**

**Principle:**
- Every category has a mental "ladder" (ranking)
- Your strategy should match your rung position
- #1, #2, #3 require different strategies

**The Mental Ladder:**

```
Category: [Product Category]
├─ Rung 1: Leader (40-50% mindshare)
├─ Rung 2: #2 (20-30% mindshare)
├─ Rung 3: #3 (10-15% mindshare)
└─ Rung 4+: Also-rans (fight for remainder)
```

**Examples:**

**Smartphones:**
1. Apple (iPhone)
2. Samsung
3. (varies by market)

**Fast Food:**
1. McDonald's
2. Burger King
3. Wendy's

**Search Engines:**
1. Google (92%+)
2. Bing (3%)
3. Yahoo (1%)

**Strategy by Rung:**

### Rung 1: Leader Strategy

**Objective:** Maintain leadership, grow category

**Tactics:**

**1. Grow the Category**
- "Drink more milk" (not "drink our milk")
- Expanding pie helps leader most
- Category evangelism

**2. Block Challengers**
- Rapid response to competitive threats
- Occupy all important positions
- Sub-brands to defend flanks

**3. Maintain Consistency**
- Don't change winning formula
- Steady, reliable messaging
- Avoid radical repositioning

**4. Out-Spend Competition**
- Maintain share of voice > share of market
- Heavy advertising presence
- Reminder advertising

**5. Continuous Innovation**
- Stay ahead technologically
- Prevent disruption
- Lead category evolution

**Example: Coca-Cola**
- Grows soft drink category (vs. water, juice)
- Launches Diet Coke, Coke Zero to block Pepsi
- Consistent red branding for 100+ years
- Massive advertising spend
- Innovation in packaging, flavors

---

### Rung 2: #2 Strategy

**Objective:** Acknowledge #2 position, position as alternative

**Tactics:**

**1. Acknowledge Position**
- "We're #2, so we try harder" (Avis)
- Honesty builds credibility
- Makes other claims believable

**2. Position as Alternative**
- "For people who don't like the leader"
- Opposite attributes
- Different audience

**3. Comparison**
- Compare directly to leader
- Mac vs. PC ads
- Pepsi Challenge

**4. Niche Focus**
- Own subcategory leader can't
- Specialize where leader is generalist

**5. Innovation**
- Leapfrog leader with innovation
- Change the game
- New technology/approach

**Example: Avis**
- "We're #2. We try harder."
- Positioned as trying harder for customer
- More attentive service than Hertz
- Made #2 position a strength

**Example: Pepsi**
- "Pepsi Generation" (younger, hipper vs. classic Coke)
- Pepsi Challenge (taste comparison)
- Celebrity endorsements (Michael Jackson, Beyoncé)

---

### Rung 3 & Below: Challenger Strategy

**Objective:** Find niche, create new category, or consolidate to #2

**Tactics:**

**1. Create New Category**
- Too hard to climb in existing category
- Define new category you can lead
- Subcategory dominance

**2. Extreme Specialization**
- Dominate narrow niche
- "Best [X] for [specific audience]"
- Small pond, big fish

**3. Merger/Acquisition**
- Combine to reach #2 or #1
- Consolidate also-rans

**4. Disruptive Innovation**
- Change the game entirely
- New technology/business model
- Make ladder obsolete

**Example: 7-Eleven (Japan)**
- Couldn't beat supermarkets on breadth
- Created "fresh food convenience" category
- Became leader in new category

**Example: Tesla**
- Couldn't beat Mercedes/BMW on luxury
- Created "premium electric vehicle" category
- Now dominates new category

---

**Ladder Dynamics:**

**Ladder Compression:**
- Most categories become 2-horse race over time
- #1 and #2 dominate
- #3+ fight for scraps

**Ladder Length:**
- High-interest categories: 7 rungs (computers, phones)
- Low-interest categories: 3 rungs (salt, rubber bands)
- Lower interest = shorter ladder

**Category Maturity:**
- New categories: Many rungs, fluid positions
- Mature categories: Few rungs, entrenched positions
- Harder to climb ladder in mature categories

---

#### Law 8: The Law of Duality
**"In the long run, every market becomes a two-horse race."**

**Principle:**
- Categories eventually consolidate to two major players
- #1 and #2 together capture 70-80%+ of market
- #3+ fight for remainder

**Examples:**

**Cola:**
1. Coca-Cola (43%)
2. Pepsi (24%)
3. Others (33% combined - dozens of brands)

**Smartphones:**
1. Apple (iOS)
2. Samsung (Android leader)
3. Others (fragmented)

**Sportswear:**
1. Nike (40%+)
2. Adidas (20%+)
3. Others (fragmented)

**Credit Cards:**
1. Visa (60%+)
2. Mastercard (30%+)
3. AmEx, Discover (single digits each)

**Rental Cars:**
1. Enterprise (45%)
2. Hertz (20%)
3. Others (fragmented)

**Implications:**

**If You're #1 or #2:**
- Fight for dominance
- Block #3 from challenging
- Invest to maintain position

**If You're #3+:**
- Create new category (don't fight in existing)
- Find niche to dominate
- Merge/acquire to reach #2
- Prepare for long battle

**Why Duality Happens:**

1. **Mental Limitation**
   - Humans remember 2 easily
   - Third is "also-ran"

2. **Distribution Power**
   - Top 2 get prime shelf space
   - #3+ fight for scraps

3. **Marketing Efficiency**
   - Top 2 can afford massive marketing
   - #3+ can't match spend

4. **Network Effects**
   - Leaders get stronger (rich get richer)
   - Laggards weaken (poor get poorer)

---

#### Law 9: The Law of the Opposite
**"If you're shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader."**

**Principle:**
- Find leader's strength, position as opposite
- Don't copy leader; differentiate
- Opposite positioning can be powerful

**Classic Examples:**

**1. 7UP: "The Uncola"**
- Coke/Pepsi = dark colas
- 7UP = clear, lemon-lime, caffeine-free
- Opposite positioning created space

**2. Avis: "We're #2. We try harder."**
- Hertz = biggest, established
- Avis = smaller, more attentive
- Turned weakness into strength

**3. Apple: "Think Different"**
- IBM = corporate, suit-and-tie, conformist
- Apple = creative, individualist, rebellious
- Opposite attracted creative professionals

**4. Volkswagen Beetle: "Think Small"**
- American cars = big, flashy, gas-guzzlers
- VW = small, practical, economical
- Opposite appealed during gas crisis

**How to Execute:**

**Step 1: Identify Leader's Strength**
- What's their core positioning?
- What do they own?
- What's their dominant attribute?

**Step 2: Find the Opposite**

| Leader Strength | Your Opposite Position |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Large | Small, nimble |
| Established | Innovative, fresh |
| Comprehensive | Simple, focused |
| Premium | Accessible, democratic |
| Traditional | Modern, progressive |
| Serious | Fun, irreverent |
| Complex/Powerful | Simple/Easy |

**Step 3: Validate Opposite is Valuable**
- Do customers want the opposite?
- Is there a segment seeking alternative?
- Can you deliver on opposite credibly?

**Step 4: Communicate Opposite**
- Direct or indirect comparison
- Show contrast
- Make opposite a benefit

**Modern Examples:**

**1. Liquid Death vs. Traditional Water**
- Traditional: Healthy, pure, gentle branding
- Liquid Death: "Murder Your Thirst," edgy metal aesthetic
- Opposite attracts different audience

**2. Lush vs. Traditional Beauty**
- Traditional: Chemical ingredients, plastic packaging
- Lush: Natural, naked (no packaging), handmade
- Opposite appeals to conscious consumers

**3. Dollar Shave Club vs. Gillette**
- Gillette: Premium, technology, expensive
- DSC: Affordable, simple, irreverent ("Our blades are f***ing great")
- Opposite positioning, different audience

---

#### Law 10: The Law of Division
**"Over time, a category will divide and become two or more categories."**

**Principle:**
- Categories don't combine; they divide
- Each division creates opportunity for new leader
- Be ready to lead new subcategory

**Historical Examples:**

**1. Computers**
- 1980s: One category (desktop computers)
- 1990s: Desktop vs. Laptop
- 2000s: + Servers, Workstations
- 2010s: + Tablets, Smartphones, Wearables
- Each division = new category leader opportunity

**Leaders:**
- Desktop: Dell, HP
- Laptop: Lenovo, Apple
- Tablets: Apple (iPad)
- Smartphones: Apple, Samsung

**2. Beer**
- Original: Beer (one category)
- 1970s: Regular vs. Light beer
- 1990s: + Import, Craft beer
- 2000s: + Microbrews, Hard seltzer, Non-alcoholic

**Leaders:**
- Regular: Budweiser
- Light: Bud Light, Coors Light
- Craft: Sierra Nevada, Dogfish Head
- Hard seltzer: White Claw

**3. Coffee**
- Original: Coffee (generic)
- 1980s: Regular vs. Premium (Starbucks)
- 1990s: + Instant, Espresso
- 2000s: + Single-serve pods (Keurig)
- 2010s: + Cold brew, Nitro, RTD canned

**Strategic Implications:**

**If You're Category Leader:**
1. **Lead Divisions**
   - Create sub-brands for each division
   - Maintain leadership across divisions
   - Example: Coca-Cola (Coke, Diet Coke, Coke Zero)

2. **Don't Fight Division**
   - Trying to be "all things" in one brand fails
   - Embrace division with multiple brands

**If You're #2+:**
1. **Lead New Division**
   - Can't win main category? Win new division
   - First in division = category leader
   - Example: Red Bull created energy drink division

2. **Anticipate Future Divisions**
   - What will divide next?
   - Position for future
   - Be first in emerging division

**How to Spot Emerging Divisions:**

**Signals:**
1. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Different customer needs emerging
   - Underserved segments

2. **Technology Change**
   - New technology enables new format
   - Streaming divided video rental

3. **Price Tiers**
   - Premium vs. Value segments
   - Each becomes its own category

4. **Distribution Channels**
   - Online vs. Offline
   - Each channel becomes category

5. **Usage Occasions**
   - Different uses = different categories
   - Beer: At-home vs. Craft brewery vs. Mass events

**How to Lead a Division:**

1. **Name It**
   - Create language for division
   - "Energy drinks" not "caffeinated sodas"

2. **Define It**
   - Clear boundaries
   - Who's included/excluded?

3. **Position for It**
   - Don't try to be leader of parent category
   - Be leader of division

4. **Dominate It**
   - Own the division
   - Make division and brand synonymous

---

### Remaining Laws (Summary)

**Law 11: Perspective**
- Short-term tactics have opposite long-term effects
- Discounting trains customers to wait for sales
- Premium pricing maintains premium perception

**Law 12: Line Extension**
- Extending successful brand to new products usually fails
- Dilutes core brand
- Success in parent category ≠ success in extension

**Law 13: Sacrifice**
- Narrow focus > broad positioning
- Sacrifice product line, target market, or constant change
- Focused brands win

**Law 14: Attributes**
- Own opposite attribute of leader
- Every attribute has effective opposite
- Find unowned valuable attribute

**Law 15: Candor**
- Admit negative to make positive believable
- "We're #2. We try harder."
- Authenticity builds trust

**Law 16: Singularity**
- One bold move produces substantial results
- Find the singular insight
- Execute boldly

**Law 17: Unpredictability**

- Build in flexibility
- Don't build entire strategy on prediction

**Law 18: Success**
- Success breeds arrogance
- Arrogance breeds failure
- Stay humble

**Law 19: Failure**
- Things go wrong; accept it
- Cut losses quickly
- Don't defend failed positioning

**Law 20: Hype**
- Real doesn't need hype
- Overhyped often fails
- Substance over hype

**Law 21: Acceleration**
- Trends beat fads
- Build for long-term trends
- Don't chase short-term fads

**Law 22: Resources**
- Without adequate resources, positioning fails
- Need marketing budget to establish position
- Great idea + no money = failure

## 2. Geoffrey Moore: Technology Adoption Lifecycle Positioning {#geoffrey-moore}

### Background

Geoffrey Moore's "Crossing the Chasm" (1991, revised 2014) focuses on positioning technology products through adoption lifecycle stages.

### The Technology Adoption Lifecycle

```
Innovators | Early Adopters | Early Majority | Late Majority | Laggards
  (2.5%)   |     (13.5%)    |     (34%)      |     (34%)     |  (16%)
           |                |                |               |
           |    THE CHASM   |                |               |
           |                |                |               |
    Enthusiasts   Visionaries   Pragmatists   Conservatives   Skeptics
```

### The Chasm

**The Problem:**
- Gap between Early Adopters (visionaries) and Early Majority (pragmatists)
- Most tech products fail here
- Different positioning needed for each side

**Why the Chasm Exists:**

**Early Adopters:**
- Want revolutionary change
- Tolerate bugs and gaps
- Willing to be reference customers
- Buy the vision

**Early Majority:**
- Want evolutionary improvement
- Need complete solutions
- Want proven references
- Buy the whole product

**The Gap:**
- Early Adopters don't influence Early Majority
- Pragmatists don't trust visionaries
- Positioning for visionaries repels pragmatists

### Crossing the Chasm Strategy

**Moore's Positioning Approach:**

**Step 1: Target a Niche**
- Choose specific beachhead segment
- Narrow focus (not broad market)
- Must be reachable and winnable

**Criteria for Niche Selection:**
1. Large enough to matter (potential $10M+ revenue)
2. Strong compelling reason to buy
3. Can serve with whole product
4. Good reference customers available
5. Jump-off point to adjacent segments

**Step 2: Assemble the Whole Product**

**Core Product:** Your actual product
**Expected Product:** Minimum for functionality
**Augmented Product:** Complete solution customer expects
**Potential Product:** Everything customer might want

**Whole Product = Everything needed for customer to achieve compelling reason to buy**

**Example: Early CRM Software**
- Core: CRM database
- Expected: Basic contact management
- Augmented: Email integration, mobile app, training, support
- Potential: Marketing automation, analytics, AI predictions

**Step 3: Position Against Market Alternative**

**Moore Positioning Statement:**

```
For (target customers - a specific niche)
Who are dissatisfied with (the current market alternative)
Our product is a (new product category)
That provides (key whole product features for solving problem)
Unlike (the product alternative)
We have assembled (key whole product features)
```

**Example: Salesforce.com (Early Days)**

```
For sales teams at small-to-medium enterprises
Who are dissatisfied with expensive, complex on-premise CRM software
Salesforce.com is a cloud-based CRM
That provides easy-to-use contact and deal management accessible anywhere
Unlike Siebel and other on-premise systems
We have assembled an affordable, easy-to-deploy solution with no software to install
```

**Step 4: Create Competitive Advantage**

**Four Categories of Competitive Advantage:**

1. **Technology discontinuity** - Truly new technology

### Moore's D-Day Strategy (Crossing the Chasm)

**The Invasion:**

Like D-Day, concentrate all resources on single beachhead:

**Step 1: Choose the Beachhead**
- One specific niche segment
- Must win completely

**Step 2: Commit Completely**
- All resources to this segment
- Ignore other opportunities temporarily
- Total commitment

**Step 3: Win Decisively**
- Become #1 in niche
- Dominate completely
- Get strong references

**Step 4: Expand to Adjacent**
- Use beachhead as reference
- Move to adjacent segments
- Bowl strategy (knock down pins)

**Beachhead Example: Salesforce**

1. **Beachhead:** Inside sales teams at SMB tech companies
2. **Why:** Clear pain (Excel spreadsheets failing), easy to reach, good references
3. **Win:** Dominated this niche completely
4. **Expand:** → Outside sales → Enterprise → All industries

---

### Key Positioning Principles (Moore)

**1. Position Against Market Alternative, Not Product Competition**
- What's the current solution?
- Usually not a competitor product; often manual process or spreadsheet
- Position as better than current solution

**2. Whole Product is the Actual Product**
- Don't sell incomplete product
- Pragmatists need complete solution
- Assemble ecosystem/partners for whole product

**3. Niche First, Expand Later**
- Win narrow niche before broad market
- Riches in niches
- Bowling pin strategy

**4. References are Everything**
- Pragmatists buy based on references
- Get 10+ reference customers before crossing chasm
- References from same niche

**5. One Compelling Reason to Buy**
- Singular focus
- One overwhelming benefit
- Not multiple features

## 3. Byron Sharp: Distinctive Brand Assets {#byron-sharp}

### Background

Byron Sharp's "How Brands Grow" (2010) challenges traditional positioning, arguing for mental and physical availability over differentiation.

### Core Principles (Challenging Traditional Positioning)

**Traditional View (Ries & Trout):**
- Differentiation is key
- Niche targeting
- Loyal customer base
- Unique positioning

**Byron Sharp's View:**
- Availability is key
- Broad targeting
- Light buyers matter most
- Distinctive assets > positioning

### The Two Types of Availability

**1. Mental Availability**

**Definition:**
The probability a brand comes to mind in buying situations.

**How to Build:**
- Distinctive brand assets (colors, logos, sounds, slogans)
- Consistent branding across all touchpoints
- Broad reach advertising (not just heavy users)
- Memory structures linking brand to category

**Metrics:**
- Top-of-mind awareness
- Spontaneous awareness
- Category entry points (CEPs)

**Example: Coca-Cola**
- Red color = distinctive
- Contour bottle shape
- Consistent visual identity 100+ years
- Massive reach (advertise everywhere)
- Result: First brand thought of for "cola" and "refreshment"

---

**2. Physical Availability**

**Definition:**
How easy it is to buy the brand.

**Components:**
- Distribution breadth (# of stores carrying)
- Distribution depth (# of facings, shelf space)
- Variant availability (sizes, flavors)
- Geographic coverage
- Online availability

**Example: Coca-Cola**
- Available in 200+ countries
- 2 billion servings per day
- Every format (bottle, can, fountain, vending)
- Every channel (grocery, convenience, restaurant, vending)

### Distinctive Brand Assets

**Definition:**
Unique brand elements that trigger brand recognition and recall.

**Types:**

**1. Visual Assets**
- Colors (Tiffany blue, Coca-Cola red, UPS brown)
- Logos and symbols
- Packaging shapes (Coca-Cola bottle, Toblerone triangle)
- Mascots and characters (Tony the Tiger, Gecko)
- Patterns and design elements

**2. Auditory Assets**
- Jingles and music (McDonald's "I'm Lovin' It")
- Sounds (Intel chime, HBO static, T-Mobile jingle)
- Voice (Morgan Freeman for Visa)

**3. Other Sensory Assets**
- Scent (Abercrombie stores)
- Taste (Coca-Cola formula)
- Touch (Apple packaging unboxing)

**4. Verbal Assets**
- Slogans ("Just Do It," "I'm Lovin' It")
- Taglines
- Brand names
- Character voices

**Building Distinctive Assets:**

**Criteria for Effective Assets:**

1. **Distinctive:** Unique to your brand
2. **Recognizable:** Easily identified
3. **Consistent:** Used consistently over time
4. **Owned:** Legally protectable
5. **Sensory:** Triggers sensory memory

**Process:**

**Step 1: Audit Current Assets**
- What visual/audio elements do you use?
- Which are most recognizable?
- Which are most unique?

**Step 2: Test Distinctiveness**
- Cover brand name; still recognizable?
- Could be confused with competitor?
- Strong association with your brand?

**Step 3: Select and Protect**
- Choose 5-7 core assets
- Trademark and protect legally
- Codify in brand guidelines

**Step 4: Use Consistently**
- Every touchpoint uses assets
- Resist temptation to change
- Long-term consistency (10+ years)

**Step 5: Measure**
- Asset recognition testing
- Unaided recall
- Category entry points

**Examples:**

**McDonald's:**
- **Visual:** Golden Arches, red & yellow
- **Audio:** "I'm Lovin' It" jingle
- **Character:** Ronald McDonald
- **Slogan:** "I'm Lovin' It"
- **Result:** Instantly recognizable globally

**Apple:**
- **Visual:** Apple logo, minimalist design, white earbuds
- **Audio:** Mac startup chime, FaceTime ringtone
- **Packaging:** Distinctive unboxing experience
- **Result:** Recognized even without name

---

### Category Entry Points (CEPs)

**Definition:**
The buying situations and usage occasions when customers think of the category.

**Why It Matters:**
- Customers buy in specific situations
- Brand must come to mind in those situations
- Compete for multiple CEPs

**Examples:**

**Snickers:**
- CEP: "When I'm hungry between meals"
- Slogan: "You're not you when you're hungry"
- Links brand to hunger occasion

**Red Bull:**
- CEP: "When I need energy"
- CEP: "Before sports/gaming"
- Links brand to energy-need occasions

**Identifying CEPs:**

**Research Questions:**
1. "When do you think about buying [category]?"
2. "What situations trigger need for [category]?"
3. "Where/when do you use [product]?"

**Example: Coffee**

**Category Entry Points:**
- Morning wake-up
- Afternoon energy slump
- Social catch-up
- Study/work session
- After dinner
- Cold weather

**Starbucks Strategy:**
- "Third place" (social CEP)
- Morning routine (wake-up CEP)
- Work location (work session CEP)

---

### Sharp's Positioning Critique

**Traditional Positioning Problems (According to Sharp):**

**Problem 1: Differentiation is Overrated**
- Customers see brands as largely similar
- Small differences don't drive choice
- Availability matters more than differentiation

**Problem 2: Loyal Customers are Minority**
- Most customers are light buyers
- They buy multiple brands
- Focus on heavy users misses majority

**Problem 3: Niche Targeting Limits Growth**
- All brands serve similar demographic profiles
- Narrowing limits reach
- Growth comes from more buyers, not more loyal buyers

**Problem 4: Emotional Positioning Often Irrelevant**
- Most purchases low-involvement
- Rational reasons cited post-purchase (rationalization)
- Availability drives purchase, emotion justifies

**Sharp's Alternative:**

**Focus on:**
1. **Mental availability** (distinctive assets, broad reach)
2. **Physical availability** (distribution, ease of purchase)
3. **Consistent branding** (don't change)
4. **Broad targeting** (reach light buyers)

**Not:**
1. ~~Unique differentiation~~
2. ~~Loyal heavy users~~
3. ~~Narrow niche~~
4. ~~Complex emotional positioning~~

---

### When to Use Sharp vs. Traditional Positioning

**Use Sharp (Distinctive Assets) When:**
- Mass-market FMCG (Coca-Cola, Tide, Snickers)
- Low-involvement purchases
- Repeat purchases
- Broad customer base
- Mature category

**Use Traditional Positioning (Ries & Trout) When:**
- B2B or considered purchases
- High-involvement
- Differentiation possible and valued
- Niche markets
- New categories or disruption

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Distinctive assets + clear positioning
- Broad reach + focused message
- Availability + differentiation

**Example: Apple**
- **Sharp:** Distinctive assets (logo, design, packaging, sounds)
- **Traditional:** Clear positioning (innovation, simplicity, design)
- **Result:** Both mental availability AND differentiation

---

## 4. Blue Ocean Strategy Framework {#blue-ocean}

### Background

W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne introduced Blue Ocean Strategy in 2005, focusing on creating uncontested market space.

### Core Concept

**Red Ocean:**
- Compete in existing market space
- Beat the competition
- Exploit existing demand
- Make value-cost trade-off
- Align system toward cost or differentiation

**Blue Ocean:**
- Create uncontested market space
- Make competition irrelevant
- Create and capture new demand
- Break value-cost trade-off
- Align system toward differentiation AND low cost

### The Strategy Canvas

**Visual tool showing:**
- X-axis: Factors industry competes on
- Y-axis: Level of offering (low to high)
- Lines: Your brand vs. competitors

**Example: Southwest Airlines (1970s)**

```
           High |
                |                    * Traditional Airlines
     Offering   |                  *   *
                |        *   *   *
                |    *           *
           Low  | *               * Southwest
                +--------------------------------
                Price Meals Lounges Seating Hub Speed
```

**Traditional Airlines:**
- High price
- Meals
- Lounges
- Seat selection
- Hub-and-spoke

**Southwest:**
- Low price
- No meals
- No lounges
- No seat selection
- Point-to-point
- High speed (fast turnaround)

**Result:** Created new market (casual air travelers who previously drove or took bus)

---

### ERRC Grid (Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create)

**Framework for value innovation:**

**1. ELIMINATE**
Which factors the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?

**2. REDUCE**
Which factors should be reduced well below industry standard?

**3. RAISE**
Which factors should be raised well above industry standard?

---

### Six Paths Framework

**Alternative ways to reconstruct market boundaries:**

**Path 1: Look Across Alternative Industries**
- What alternatives do customers choose between?
- What do they really hire the product for?

**Example:**
- Movie theater alternatives: Video streaming, restaurants, bars
- Insight: Compete on "night out" not just "entertainment"

**Path 2: Look Across Strategic Groups**
- What are the different strategic groups (premium, mid-tier, budget)?
- Can you combine best of multiple groups?

**Example:**
- Curves (gym): Combined cheap budget gyms + convenience + women-only
- Result: New category (30-minute women's gym)

**Path 3: Look Across Chain of Buyers**
- Who are the different buyers/influencers/users?
- Focus on different buyer than industry focuses on?

**Example:**
- Bloomberg: Focused on traders (users), not IT buyers
- Result: Terminals on every trader desk

**Path 4: Look Across Complementary Products/Services**
- What happens before, during, after product use?
- What complementary products are used?

**Example:**
- IKEA: Furniture + childcare + restaurant = family destination
- Result: Longer visits, more purchases

**Path 5: Look Across Functional or Emotional Appeal**
- Industry competes on function or emotion?
- Can you flip it?

**Example:**
- Swatch: Made watches emotional (fashion) not functional (timekeeping)
- Result: Created fashion watch category

**Path 6: Look Across Time**
- What trends are occurring?
- Can you anticipate and leap?

**Example:**
- Apple iTunes: Anticipated shift from CDs to digital
- Result: Dominated music downloads

---

### Blue Ocean Positioning

**How to Position Blue Ocean:**

**1. Name the New Category**
- Don't position as "better [old category]"
- Create new category name
- Define boundaries

**Examples:**
- Cirque du Soleil: "Artistic theater" (not circus)
- Yellow Tail: "Easy wine" (not cheap wine)
- Nintendo Wii: "Family entertainment system" (not game console)

**2. Communicate Value Innovation**
- Show how you're different AND affordable
- Break perceived trade-off
- "You don't have to choose"

**3. Focus on Non-Customers**
- Who doesn't buy existing category?
- Why don't they buy?
- How does your blue ocean attract them?

**Three Tiers of Non-Customers:**

**Tier 1: "Soon-to-be" noncustomers**
- On edge of market
- Minimally use existing options
- Ready to jump ship

**Tier 2: "Refusing" noncustomers**
- Have seen options, consciously reject
- Needs not met by existing

**Tier 3: "Unexplored" noncustomers**
- Never considered category
- Distant from market

**4. Demonstrate the Shift**
- Before/after comparison
- Show old rules vs. new rules
- Make shift visible

**Example: Uber Positioning**

**Old Rules (Taxi):**
- Call and wait (or hail)
- Cash payment
- Unknown cost
- Unpredictable quality

**New Rules (Uber):**
- Tap and track
- Automatic payment
- Upfront pricing
- Rated drivers

**Result:** Attracted people who hated taxis (non-customers)

---

### Blue Ocean Cautions

**Risks:**

1. **Not Enough Value Innovation**
   - Just being different isn't enough
   - Must create meaningful value
   - Must be defensible

2. **Too Ahead of Market**
   - Market not ready
   - Education cost too high
   - Timing wrong

3. **Can't Scale**
   - Works in niche
   - Doesn't scale to mass market
   - Profitability challenges

4. **Copyable**
   - No barriers to entry
   - Competitors quickly copy
   - Blue ocean turns red

**Success Criteria:**

✅ **Meaningful differentiation**
✅ **Substantial cost reduction OR value increase**
✅ **Attracts new customers**
✅ **Defensible (for 5+ years)**
✅ **Scalable business model**

## 5. Jobs-to-be-Done Positioning {#jtbd}

### Background

Clayton Christensen popularized "Jobs-to-be-Done" theory: Customers don't buy products; they "hire" them to do a job.

### Core Concept

**"What job did you hire that product to do?"**

**Not:**
- Demographics
- Psychographics
- Product features

**Instead:**
- The progress customers want to make
- The job they're trying to get done
- The outcome they seek

### The Milkshake Marketing Story

**Classic Example:**

**The Question:**
How to sell more milkshakes in fast food?

**Traditional Research:**
- Survey demographics
- Ask about taste preferences
- Test new flavors

**Result:** No improvement

**JTBD Research:**
- Observed when people bought milkshakes
- Asked: "What job did you hire that milkshake to do?"

**Insights:**

**Morning Commuters:**
- **Job:** Make boring commute interesting
- **Job:** Fill me up until lunch
- **Competing products:** Bananas (too quick), bagels (messy), coffee (not filling)
- **Why milkshake wins:** Takes 20 minutes to consume, interesting, filling, fits in cupholder

**Parents with Kids:**
- **Job:** Make child happy
- **Job:** Feel like good parent
- **Competing products:** Toys, candy
- **Why milkshake:** Harmless fun, not too expensive

**Implication:**
- Two different jobs
- Two different products needed
- Morning: Thick, filling, fruit chunks
- Kids: Thin, fast, fun flavors

---

### JTBD Framework

**Three Types of Jobs:**

**1. Functional Job**
Tasks customers want to accomplish

**Examples:**
- "Get from A to B"
- "Stay in touch with friends"
- "Track my expenses"

**2. Emotional Job**
How customers want to feel

**Examples:**
- "Feel confident"
- "Reduce anxiety"
- "Feel entertained"

**3. Social Job**
How customers want to be perceived

**Examples:**
- "Look successful"
- "Be seen as environmentally conscious"
- "Appear knowledgeable"

**Complete Job = Functional + Emotional + Social**

---

### Positioning with JTBD

**JTBD Positioning Statement:**

```
When [situation]
I want to [motivation]
So I can [expected outcome]
```

**Examples:**

**Uber:**
```
When I need to get somewhere
I want to tap a button and get a ride
So I can arrive on time without the hassle of parking or hailing a taxi
```

**Slack:**
```
When I need to collaborate with my team
I want to have all our conversations and files in one place
So I can find information quickly and keep everyone aligned
```

**Airbnb:**
```
When I travel to a new city
I want to stay in a local's home
So I can experience the city like a local, not a tourist
```

---

### Discovering Jobs-to-be-Done

**Interview Questions:**

**1. Timeline Questions:**
- "Walk me through the last time you [hired product]"
- "What happened right before?"
- "What were you trying to accomplish?"

**2. Motivation Questions:**
- "Why was this important to you?"
- "What would have happened if you didn't [hire product]?"
- "What were you hoping would change?"

**3. Alternatives Questions:**
- "What else did you consider?"
- "What were you doing before?"
- "What almost stopped you from [hiring product]?"

**4. Outcome Questions:**
- "How did it go?"
- "What changed afterward?"
- "Did it solve the problem you had?"

**Pattern Recognition:**

Look for:
- **Struggling moments** (push away from current solution)
- **First thought** (when they first realized they had a problem)
- **Passive looking** (casual exploration of alternatives)
- **Active looking** (serious search for solution)
- **Decision** (moment of purchase)
- **Consumption** (using the product)
- **Satisfaction** (did it deliver?)

---

### Job Stories (Alternative to User Stories)

**Traditional User Story:**
```
As a [type of user]
I want [feature]
So that [benefit]
```

**Problem:** Assumes user type, not context

**Job Story:**
```
When [situation]
I want to [motivation]
So I can [expected outcome]
```

**Advantage:** Focuses on context and causality, not persona

**Examples:**

**Bad (User Story):**
```
As a busy professional
I want a to-do list app
So that I can stay organized
```

**Good (Job Story):**
```
When I'm in a meeting and someone assigns me a task
I want to quickly capture it
So I can free my mind and not worry about forgetting
```

---

### Competing Against "Non-Consumption"

**Biggest competitor = doing nothing**

**Why customers don't hire any solution:**
- Too expensive
- Too complicated
- Too risky
- Not enough pain
- Workarounds "good enough"

**How to compete against non-consumption:**

**1. Make it easier**
- Reduce complexity
- Lower barriers to entry
- Simplify onboarding

**Example: Canva vs. Photoshop**
- Photoshop: Professional, complex, expensive
- Canva: Simple, free, templated
- Result: Attracted non-designers who previously did nothing

**2. Make it cheaper**
- Reduce cost barrier
- Freemium model
- Free trial

**Example: Dropbox**
- Free 2GB tier
- Eliminated "too expensive" objection
- Grew to 700M+ users

**3. Make it less risky**
- Money-back guarantees
- Free trials
- Testimonials and social proof

**Example: Warby Parker**
- Home try-on (5 frames free)
- Free shipping both ways
- Eliminated "what if I don't like them?" risk

---

### JTBD Positioning Examples

**1. Superhuman (Email)**

**Job:** When I'm overwhelmed by email, I want to get to inbox zero fast, so I can focus on important work

**Positioning:** "The fastest email experience ever made"

**Competing against:**
- Gmail (free but slow)
- Outlook (feature-rich but overwhelming)
- Non-consumption (ignoring email)

**Why it works:** Focuses on speed (main job), charges premium ($30/month) because job is valuable

---

**2. Calm (Meditation App)**

**Job:** When I'm anxious or can't sleep, I want to quickly calm my mind, so I can relax and fall asleep

**Positioning:** "Sleep more. Stress less. Live better."

**Competing against:**
- Headspace (meditation for everyone)
- YouTube meditation videos (free but low quality)
- Sleeping pills (effective but side effects)

**Why it works:** Focuses on sleep and stress (main jobs), not general meditation

---

**3. Peloton**

**Job:** When I want to work out but don't want to go to a gym, I want a studio-quality class at home, so I can stay fit with the motivation of an instructor

**Positioning:** "Studio-quality fitness at home"

**Competing against:**
- Gym memberships (inconvenient)
- YouTube workout videos (free but no accountability)
- Treadmill/bike (boring, no motivation)

**Why it works:** Combines convenience of home with motivation of studio class

---
