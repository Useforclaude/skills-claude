# Brand Voice Skill

This skill helps maintain a consistent brand voice across all content types. Read this before writing any customer-facing content.

## Quick Start

Before writing ANY content:
1. Review the brand personality below
2. Check tone adjustments for the specific channel
3. Refer to references/ for detailed examples
4. Use the writing checklist before finalizing

## Brand Personality

Our brand is **Friendly Expert** - like a knowledgeable friend who's excited to help.

**Core traits:**
- 60% Friendly: Warm, approachable, conversational
- 40% Professional: Credible, reliable, knowledgeable
- Optimistic and empowering
- Human, never corporate

**Think of us as:** The friend who knows their stuff and genuinely wants to see you succeed.

## Writing Principles

### 1. Use Active Voice
‚úÖ "We help you save time"
‚ùå "Time can be saved through our solution"

**Rule:** 90% active voice, 10% passive (when passive is truly better)

### 2. Write Conversationally
‚úÖ "Here's what we found..."
‚ùå "Our research indicates that..."

‚úÖ "You'll love this feature because..."
‚ùå "This feature provides benefits such as..."

### 3. Keep It Simple
- Average sentence length: 15-20 words
- One idea per sentence
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Break up text with subheadings

### 4. Be Personal
‚úÖ Use: you, we, your, our
‚ùå Avoid: one, they, the user, the customer

‚úÖ "You can customize your dashboard"
‚ùå "Users can customize their dashboards"

### 5. Show, Don't Tell
‚úÖ "Reply to customers in seconds, not hours"
‚ùå "Fast customer service"

‚úÖ "Write once, publish everywhere"
‚ùå "Efficient content distribution"

## Tone Adjustments by Channel

### Social Media (Casual, Fun)
- More emojis (but not excessive)
- Shorter sentences
- Questions to drive engagement
- Trending formats okay
- Can be playful

Example:
```
Big news! üéâ

We just launched a feature you've been asking for: auto-save drafts.

No more lost work. No more panic. Just smooth writing.

Try it now ‚Üí [link]
```

### Email Marketing (Personal, Action-Oriented)
- Subject lines: curiosity + benefit
- First line: hook immediately
- Clear CTA (one per email)
- P.S. for extra value/urgency

Example:
```
Subject: Your content is taking too long (here's why)

Hey [Name],

Quick question: How long does it take you to write a blog post?

If it's more than 2 hours, you're probably stuck in the "perfectionist trap."

Here's what actually works...
```

### Landing Pages (Benefit-Focused, Conversion)
- Headlines: clear benefit in <10 words
- Subheadlines: expand the promise
- Bullet points: specific outcomes
- CTAs: action verbs + benefit

Example:
```
Headline: Create Content 3x Faster
Subhead: Write, edit, and publish in one place. No more switching between tools.

- Draft blog posts in 30 minutes (not 3 hours)
- Optimize for SEO automatically
- Publish to all channels with one click
```

### Product UI (Clear, Helpful)
- Ultra-concise (3-7 words)
- Action-oriented
- No jargon
- Helpful, not bossy

Example:
```
‚úÖ "Save changes?"
‚ùå "Would you like to persist your modifications?"

‚úÖ "Add image"
‚ùå "Upload media file"

‚úÖ "This field is required"
‚ùå "Error: Null value exception"
```

## Forbidden Phrases

These words/phrases damage our brand voice:

**Corporate Jargon:**
- ‚ùå Synergy, leverage, utilize, facilitate
- ‚ùå Value proposition, thought leader
- ‚ùå Best-in-class, world-class
- ‚ùå Cutting-edge, revolutionary, game-changing

**Passive/Weak:**
- ‚ùå "It should be noted that..."
- ‚ùå "One might consider..."
- ‚ùå "This allows users to..."

**Overpromising:**
- ‚ùå "Guaranteed results"
- ‚ùå "The best solution"
- ‚ùå "Never fail"

**Use Instead:**
- ‚úÖ Use, help, make easier
- ‚úÖ What we believe, our approach
- ‚úÖ High-quality, excellent
- ‚úÖ Modern, innovative, effective

## Writing Checklist

Before publishing ANY content:

- [ ] Reads naturally when spoken aloud
- [ ] Uses "you" and "we" (not "the user")
- [ ] Active voice dominates (90%+)
- [ ] Sentences average 15-20 words
- [ ] No corporate jargon
- [ ] Specific benefits, not vague claims
- [ ] One clear call-to-action
- [ ] Matches channel-specific tone
- [ ] Brand personality shines through

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

### Mistake 1: Too Corporate
‚ùå "Our platform facilitates optimization of workflow processes"
‚úÖ "We help you work faster"

### Mistake 2: Too Vague
‚ùå "Improve your productivity"
‚úÖ "Save 10 hours per week on admin tasks"

### Mistake 3: Feature-Focused
‚ùå "Advanced AI algorithms"
‚úÖ "Writes headlines that get 2x more clicks"

### Mistake 4: Too Passive
‚ùå "The document can be edited by clicking the button"
‚úÖ "Click the button to edit your document"

### Mistake 5: Missing Emotion
‚ùå "Efficient project management software"
‚úÖ "Finally, a project manager that doesn't stress you out"
