## Core Cognitive Biases (100+)

### Category 1: Decision-Making Biases (20)

#### 1. Anchoring Bias
**Definition:** Over-reliance on the first piece of information encountered.

**How it works:**
- First number sets mental reference point
- Subsequent judgments adjust from anchor
- Affects price perception, negotiations

**Marketing applications:**
- Original price: $299 → Sale: $99 (anchor high)
- "Most popular" package in middle (anchor expectations)
- "Starting at $9.99" (low anchor for entry)

**Ethical use:**
- Show genuine original prices
- Don't inflate anchors artificially
- Provide context for comparisons

**Protection:**
- Research market prices independently
- Ignore first price shown
- Focus on absolute value, not relative

---

#### 2. Availability Heuristic
**Definition:** Overestimate likelihood of events that are easily recalled.

**How it works:**
- Recent/vivid memories seem more common
- Media coverage distorts probability perception
- Emotional events are more "available"

**Marketing applications:**
- "1 in 3 people suffer from..." (makes it seem common)
- Testimonials create vivid success stories
- News-jacking trending topics

**Ethical use:**
- Use accurate statistics
- Don't exaggerate prevalence
- Provide balanced perspective

**Protection:**
- Check actual statistics
- Don't rely on memory alone
- Consider base rates

---

#### 3. Confirmation Bias
**Definition:** Seek/interpret information confirming existing beliefs.

**How it works:**

**Ethical use:**
- Present balanced information
- Acknowledge limitations
- Don't hide contradicting data

**Protection:**
- Actively seek disconfirming evidence
- Play devil's advocate
- Consult diverse sources

---

#### 4. Loss Aversion
**Definition:** Losses feel twice as painful as equivalent gains feel good.

**How it works:**
- Fear of losing > desire to gain
- Status quo bias (avoid change/loss)
- Endowment effect (overvalue what we own)

**Marketing applications:**
- "Don't miss out" (fear of losing opportunity)
- Free trials (create ownership before payment)
- "Cancel anytime" (reduce fear of losing money)
- "Limited time" (losing opportunity)

**Ethical use:**
- Genuine scarcity/deadlines only
- Don't create false urgency
- Honor cancellation policies

**Protection:**
- Evaluate based on gains, not losses
- Ignore artificial scarcity

---

#### 5. Framing Effect
**Definition:** Same information presented differently leads to different decisions.

**Marketing applications:**

**Marketing applications:**
- Small ($5), Medium ($8), Large ($9) → Most buy Large

**Ethical use:**

## Ethical Marketing Framework

### Core Principles

1. **Informed Consent**: Users should make decisions with full information
2. **Transparency**: Be clear about persuasion tactics
3. **Reversibility**: Easy to undo decisions (returns, cancellations)
4. **Non-Exploitation**: Don't target vulnerabilities
5. **Truth**: Accurate claims, genuine scarcity/urgency

### Ethical Use Checklist

- [ ] Are claims accurate and verifiable?
- [ ] Is scarcity/urgency genuine?
- [ ] Can users easily reverse decisions?
- [ ] Are all fees/terms clearly disclosed?
- [ ] Does product deliver promised value?
- [ ] Are testimonials/reviews authentic?
- [ ] Is social proof real (not inflated)?
- [ ] Do defaults benefit the user?
- [ ] Is comparison fair and accurate?
- [ ] Are limitations acknowledged?

### Red Flags (Avoid These)

- Fake scarcity (unlimited "limited edition")
- Hidden fees or terms
- Impossible-to-cancel subscriptions
- Fabricated social proof
- Manipulated before/after photos
- Cherry-picked statistics
- False authority (fake credentials)
- Predatory targeting (vulnerable populations)
- Dark patterns (designed confusion)
- Bait and switch

## Self-Protection Guide

2. **Research independently** (don't rely on seller info)
3. **Check actual reviews** (verified purchases only)
4. **Calculate total cost** (including all fees, interest)
5. **Compare 3+ options** objectively
6. **Ask "Why now?"** (is urgency real?)
7. **Read fine print** (cancellation, returns, fees)
8. **Check return policy** before buying
9. **Ignore sunk costs** (past spending irrelevant)
10. **Question defaults** (change to your preference)

### During Shopping

- **Mute notifications** (reduce urgency manipulation)

### Decision-Making Tools

**WRAP Framework** (Chip & Dan Heath):
1. **Widen options**: Consider more alternatives
2. **Reality-test assumptions**: Get objective data
3. **Attain distance**: 10/10/10 rule (how will I feel in 10 min/months/years?)
4. **Prepare to be wrong**: Set decision triggers

**Pre-Mortem Analysis**:
- Imagine purchase was a disaster
- What went wrong?
- How can you prevent it?

**Outside View**:
- How did similar purchases turn out?
- What do statistics say?
- What would you advise a friend?

- Framing: "Less than $1/day" instead of "$297/year"

**Bottom**:
- Recency: Strong CTA with benefit
- Endowment: "Start your free trial"
- Zero-risk: "60-day money-back guarantee"

### Email Campaigns

**Subject lines**:
- Loss aversion: "Don't lose your [benefit]"
- Curiosity gap: "The one thing we changed that..."
- Personalization: "John, your exclusive..."

**Body**:
- Mere exposure: Consistent branding/messaging
- Reciprocity: Provide value first
- Commitment: Small ask → larger ask

### Pricing Psychology

**Anchoring strategies**:
```
❌ Basic: $29, Pro: $99
✅ Enterprise: $999, Pro: $99, Basic: $29
(Anchor high, make Pro seem reasonable)
```

**Decoy pricing**:
```
Small coffee: $3
Medium coffee: $4.50
Large coffee: $5

(Large seems like best value)
```

**Framing**:
```
❌ "Costs $365/year"
✅ "Only $1/day"
```

### A/B Test Ideas

1. **Anchoring**: Show/hide original price
2. **Social proof**: Different numbers/phrasings
3. **Scarcity**: "Limited time" vs "Limited quantity" vs control
4. **Framing**: Gain frame vs loss frame
5. **Default**: Opt-in vs opt-out
6. **Decoy**: 2 options vs 3 options (with decoy)
7. **Authority**: With/without expert endorsement
8. **Urgency**: Countdown timer vs no timer
9. **Endowment**: Free trial vs paid trial
10. **Guarantee**: 30-day vs 60-day vs lifetime

### Key Studies

**Kahneman & Tversky (1979)** - Prospect Theory
- Loss aversion formalization
- Value function asymmetry
- Foundation of behavioral economics

**Ariely et al. (2003)** - Decoy Effect
- Magazine subscription study
- Asymmetric dominance
- Context-dependent preferences

**Cialdini (2001)** - Influence Principles
- 6 principles of persuasion
- Reciprocity, commitment, social proof, authority, liking, scarcity
- Practical applications

**Schwartz (2004)** - Paradox of Choice
- Choice overload effect
- Decision satisfaction
- Maximizers vs satisficers

**Thaler & Sunstein (2008)** - Nudge
- Choice architecture
- Libertarian paternalism
- Default effects

### Meta-Analyses

**Social Proof** (Bond & Smith, 1996): Average effect size d=0.58
**Scarcity** (Lynn, 1991): Significant effect across cultures
**Framing** (Levin et al., 1998): Robust across contexts
**Anchoring** (Furnham & Boo, 2011): Effect persists even with awareness

## Advanced Applications

### Combining Multiple Biases

**Example: SaaS Landing Page**
```
Hero: "Join 50,000+ marketers" (Social proof + Bandwagon)
Pricing: Was $199 → Now $99 (Anchoring + Scarcity)
Tiers: Basic $49, Pro $99, Enterprise $299 (Decoy effect)
CTA: "Start free 14-day trial" (Endowment + Zero-risk)
Deadline: "Offer ends Sunday" (Loss aversion + Present bias)
```

**Bias stack**:
1. Social proof builds trust
2. Anchoring sets high reference
3. Decoy makes Pro attractive
4. Endowment from free trial
5. Loss aversion from deadline

### Bias Mitigation

**For Companies**:
- A/B test ethical vs manipulative approaches
- Long-term customer value > short-term conversion
- Transparent practices build trust
- Easy cancellation = higher lifetime value

**For Consumers**:
- Decision journals (track outcomes)
- Pre-commitment devices (Ulysses contracts)
- Cooling-off periods (mandatory waiting)
- External accountability (tell friends your decision)

## Industry-Specific Applications
