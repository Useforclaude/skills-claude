## E-Commerce Examples

### Amazon Prime

**Biases Used**:
- **Endowment Effect**: Free trial creates ownership
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Annual fee → "I paid, must use it"
- **Mental Accounting**: "Free shipping" (already paid in membership)
- **Default Effect**: Auto-renewal after trial

**Implementation**:
```
"Try Prime FREE for 30 days"
↓
Use Prime shipping/video
↓
"Your trial ends in 3 days" (loss aversion)
↓
Auto-renewal (default effect + status quo bias)
```

**Results**: 200M+ Prime members, 90%+ retention rate

**Why It Works**:
1. Trial creates ownership feeling
2. Use during trial → perceived value
3. Fear of losing benefits → conversion
4. Auto-renewal = friction-free continuation

[Countdown: 3h 27m remaining]
"List Price: $149.99"
"Deal Price: $79.99 (47% off)"

👥 "23 people are looking at this property right now"
🔥 "In high demand – booked 3 times in the last 6 hours"
⏰ "Free cancellation until Feb 15"
```

**Controversy**: EU fined Booking.com for misleading urgency claims (some were exaggerated)

**Ethical Concerns**:

Standard: $15.49/month (2 screens, HD) ← Default/highlighted
Premium: $19.99/month (4 screens, 4K)

```
1. Free: 2GB (start storing files → endowment)
2. "You're using 1.8GB of 2GB" → anxiety (loss aversion)
3. "Upgrade to Plus: 2TB for $9.99/month"

## Multi-Bias Combinations

### Landing Page Optimization Stack

**Above Fold**:
1. **Headline**: "Join 500,000+ marketers" (Social proof + Bandwagon)
2. **Subheadline**: "Don't let your competitors get ahead" (Loss aversion + FOMO)
3. **Pricing**: "~~$997~~ $97" (Anchoring)

**Mid-Page**:
4. **Testimonials**: Photos + names (Authority + Social proof)
5. **Scarcity**: "Only 47 spots left" (Scarcity)
6. **Risk Reversal**: "60-day money-back guarantee" (Zero-risk bias)

**Bottom CTA**:
7. **Urgency**: "Offer ends Sunday" (Time-limited scarcity)
8. **Action**: "Start Free Trial" (Endowment effect)

**Why It Works**: Multiple biases create psychological pressure from different angles
