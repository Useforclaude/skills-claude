# Research Backing for Cognitive Biases

## Foundational Research

### Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)

**Citation**: Kahneman, D., & Tversky, A. (1979). Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk. *Econometrica*, 47(2), 263-291.

**Key Findings**:
- **Loss aversion**: Losses are felt ~2.25x more than equivalent gains
- **Value function**: S-shaped curve (concave for gains, convex for losses)
- **Probability weighting**: People overweight small probabilities, underweight large ones
- **Reference dependence**: Evaluate outcomes relative to reference point

**Impact**: Foundation of behavioral economics; 2002 Nobel Prize

**Marketing Applications**:
- Frame as loss avoidance vs gain seeking

### Anchoring & Adjustment (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)

**Citation**: Tversky, A., & Kahneman, D. (1974). Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases. *Science*, 185(4157), 1124-1131.

**Key Findings**:
- Initial anchor affects subsequent judgments
- Effect persists even with:
  - Awareness of bias
  - Incentives for accuracy
  - Expert knowledge
- Anchoring effect size: d = 0.5-1.5 (medium to large)

**Classic Experiments**:
1. **Wheel of Fortune**: Spin random number → estimate % of African nations in UN

2. **Real Estate Prices**: List price affects perceived value and offers
3. **Legal Sentencing**: Prosecutors' recommendations anchor sentences

**Marketing Applications**:
- Show "original price" before sale price
- Present premium option first
- Use "starting at $X" for low anchor

**Meta-Analysis**: Furnham & Boo (2011) - 28 studies, d = 0.41 average effect

- Jar with 10 cookies vs 2 cookies
- 2 cookies rated significantly more desirable
- **Increased scarcity** (10→2) > constant scarcity (always 2)
- Social scarcity (others want it) > physical scarcity

**Key Findings**:
- Scarcity increases perceived value by 50%
- Time-limited > quantity-limited

**Classic Study - The Economist Subscription**:
```
Option A: Web-only $59
Option B: Print-only $125
Option C: Web + Print $125

Without Decoy (A vs C):
- 68% chose A (web)
- 32% chose C (both)

With Decoy (A vs B vs C):
- 16% chose A (web)
- 0% chose B (print) ← DECOY
- 84% chose C (both)
```

**Result**: Decoy increased revenue per customer by 43%

**Mechanism**:

**Jam Study**:
- **24 varieties**: 60% stopped, 3% bought
- **6 varieties**: 40% stopped, 30% bought
- **10x conversion rate** with fewer options

**Follow-up Studies**:
- Chocolate assortment: 30 vs 6 → Similar results
- Essay topics: 30 vs 6 → Better quality with fewer
- 401(k) plans: Each 10 funds → 2% less participation

**Mechanism**:
- Decision fatigue
- Fear of making wrong choice
- Regret anticipation
- Analysis paralysis

**Marketing Applications**:
- Limit to 3-5 options
- Default/recommended option
- Progressive disclosure
- Filtering/navigation

**Boundary Conditions**:
- Expert consumers less affected
- High involvement categories benefit from more choice
- Preference uncertainty amplifies effect

**Meta-Analysis**: Scheibehenne et al. (2010) - Effect is robust but context-dependent

**Citation**: Tversky, A., & Kahneman, D. (1981). The framing of decisions and the psychology of choice. *Science*, 211(4481), 453-458.

**Asian Disease Problem**:
```
Scenario: 600 people will die from disease. Choose program:

Gain Frame:
- Program A: 200 people will be saved (72% choose)
- Program B: 1/3 chance 600 saved, 2/3 chance none saved (28% choose)

Loss Frame:
- Program C: 400 people will die (22% choose)
- Program D: 1/3 chance nobody dies, 2/3 chance 600 die (78% choose)
```

**Result**: A and C are identical, as are B and D. Framing reverses preference.

**Key Insights**:
- Positive frame → risk aversion
- Negative frame → risk seeking
- Effect size: 40-50% preference shift

**Marketing Applications**:
- "90% fat-free" vs "10% fat"
- "Save $50" vs "Only $50 more"
- "9 out of 10" vs "1 out of 10 fail"

**Meta-Analysis**: Kühberger (1998) - 136 studies, robust effect across domains

- **Sellers** (have mug): Minimum price to sell = $7.12
- **Buyers** (don't have): Maximum price to buy = $2.87
- **2.5x valuation gap** from mere ownership

**Mechanism**:
- Loss aversion applied to owned items
- Ownership creates attachment
- Mental accounting shifts

**Marketing Applications**:
- **Free trials**: Create ownership before purchase

**Colonoscopy Study**:
- Group A: Painful procedure, abrupt end
- Group B: Same procedure + extra 60s (less painful)
- **Group B** reported better overall experience despite more total pain
- **Peak pain** + **end pain** dominated memory, not duration

**Key Insights**:
- Duration neglect: Time matters less than peak and end
- Recency bias: End disproportionately important
- Average experience largely forgotten

**Marketing Applications**:
- **Customer service**: End interactions positively
- **Unboxing experience**: Peak moment of delight

**Key Findings**:
- Bottom quartile: Think they're 62nd percentile (actual: 12th percentile)
- Top quartile: Think they're 75th percentile (actual: 88th percentile)
- Incompetent overestimate by ~50 percentile points
- Experts underestimate by ~15 percentile points

**Mechanism**:
- Metacognitive inability: Don't know what they don't know
- Lack of feedback/calibration
- Knowledge curse: Experts forget beginner state

**Marketing Implications**:
- **Beginner products**: "No expertise needed"

### IKEA Effect (Norton, Mochon & Ariely, 2012)

**Citation**: Norton, M. I., Mochon, D., & Ariely, D. (2012). The IKEA effect: When labor leads to love. *Journal of Consumer Psychology*, 22(3), 453-460.

**Key Studies**:
1. **IKEA furniture**: Self-assembled valued 63% higher than pre-assembled
2. **Origami**: Builders valued their creations as much as expert origami
3. **Build-a-Bear**: Custom bears valued higher than pre-made

**Mechanism**:
- Effort creates attachment
- "I made this" → emotional value
- Competence signal (to self)
- Invested time/energy

**Boundary Conditions**:
- Must successfully complete (failure = no effect)
- Moderate effort optimal (too easy or impossible = no effect)
- Own creations only (watching someone else = no effect)

**Marketing Applications**:

### Availability Heuristic (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973)

**Citation**: Tversky, A., & Kahneman, D. (1973). Availability: A heuristic for judging frequency and probability. *Cognitive Psychology*, 5(2), 207-232.

**Classic Examples**:
1. **K position**: More words start with K or have K as 3rd letter?
   - Most say "start with K" (wrong - 3x more with K in 3rd position)
   - Starting words are more "available" to memory

2. **Cause of death**: Asked to estimate frequencies
   - Overestimate: Dramatic deaths (shark attacks, terrorism)
   - Underestimate: Common deaths (diabetes, heart disease)
   - Media coverage distorts availability

**Mechanism**:
- Ease of recall = frequency estimate
- Recent, vivid, emotional = more available
- Representativeness heuristic overlap

**Marketing Applications**:
- **Testimonials**: Create vivid, memorable stories
- **Case studies**: Make success "available"
- **News-jacking**: Tie product to current events
- **Emotional ads**: More memorable = more "common"

**Field Studies**:
- After shark attack news: Beach attendance drops 15%
- After terrorist attack: Air travel drops, driving deaths increase
- Celebrity endorsement: Increases perceived popularity 40%

**2-4-6 Task**:
- Rule: "Three ascending numbers"
- Most guess: "Even numbers increasing by 2"
- Test: 6-8-10 (confirms), 20-22-24 (confirms)
- Never test: 3-5-7 (would disconfirm specific hypothesis)
- Result: 80% fail to find actual rule

**Mechanism**:
- Seek confirming evidence
- Avoid disconfirming tests
- Interpret ambiguous evidence as support
- Remember confirming instances

**Marketing Applications**:
- **Targeted ads**: Show ads to those already interested
- **Testimonials**: Match buyer persona
- **Content**: "You already know that..." (assume agreement)
- **Retargeting**: Reinforce existing interest

**Effect in the Wild**:
- Political media: Echo chambers
- Product reviews: Seek positive reviews
- Investment decisions: Seek supporting data
- Medical diagnosis: Confirm initial hypothesis

**Meta-Analysis**: Nickerson (1998) - Pervasive across domains

## Meta-Analyses & Reviews

### Comprehensive Reviews

**Kahneman (2011) - *Thinking, Fast and Slow***
- System 1 (fast, automatic) → biases
- System 2 (slow, deliberate) → can override but lazy
- Comprehensive review of 40 years of research

**Thaler & Sunstein (2008) - *Nudge***
- Choice architecture applications
- Libertarian paternalism
- Policy and marketing implications

**Ariely (2008) - *Predictably Irrational***
- Systematic irrationality
- Patterns in "irrational" behavior
- Practical applications

### Meta-Analytic Effect Sizes

| Bias | Effect Size (Cohen's d) | Studies | Notes |
|------|------------------------|---------|-------|
| Anchoring | 0.41 | 28 | Furnham & Boo (2011) |
| Social Proof | 0.58 | 133 | Bond & Smith (1996) |
| Framing | 0.43 | 136 | Kühberger (1998) |
| Mere Exposure | 0.26 (r) | 200+ | Bornstein (1989) |
| Loss Aversion | 2.25 ratio | 100+ | Kahneman & Tversky |
| Decoy Effect | 0.6-1.2 | 50+ | Heath & Chatterjee (1995) |
| Scarcity | 0.65 | 45 | Lynn (1991) |
| Endowment | 2.5 ratio | 60+ | Kahneman et al. (1990) |

**Interpretation**:
- d = 0.2: Small effect
- d = 0.5: Medium effect
- d = 0.8: Large effect

Most cognitive biases show **medium to large effects** in controlled studies.

---

## Boundary Conditions & Moderators

### When Biases Are Stronger

1. **Low involvement**: Less attention → more susceptible
2. **Time pressure**: Quick decisions rely on heuristics
3. **Information overload**: Cognitive shortcuts increase
4. **Emotional arousal**: System 1 dominates
5. **Unfamiliar domains**: Lack of expertise → heuristics

### When Biases Are Weaker

1. **High awareness**: Training can reduce some biases
2. **Strong incentives**: Accuracy motivation helps (partially)
3. **Expert domains**: Domain expertise reduces specific biases
4. **Deliberate processing**: Slow, careful thinking
5. **Debiasing techniques**: Structured decision processes

### Individual Differences

**Cognitive Reflection Test** (Frederick, 2005):
- Measures System 2 engagement
- Higher CRT → less susceptible to some biases
- But even high CRT individuals show biases

**Intelligence**:
- Correlation with bias susceptibility: r = -0.15 to -0.30
- Smart people still biased (blind spot bias)

**Personality**:
- Need for cognition → less availability heuristic
- Openness → less confirmation bias
- Conscientiousness → less present bias

---

## Ethical Considerations in Research

### Informed Consent

**Milgram (1963)** - Obedience study:
- Participants believed they were shocking people
- Significant psychological distress
- Led to modern ethical standards

**Modern Standards**:
- IRB approval required
- Debriefing mandatory
- Right to withdraw
- Minimize deception

### Real-World Applications

**Nudge Ethics** (Hansen & Jespersen, 2013):
- **Transparent**: Users aware of influence attempts?
- **Easy to resist**: Opt-out available?
- **Beneficial**: In user's interest?
- **Democratic**: Accountable processes?

**Marketing Ethics**:
- **Truth**: Accurate claims only
- **Autonomy**: Preserve real choice
- **Vulnerability**: Don't exploit weakness
- **Transparency**: Disclose persuasion tactics

---

## Practical Implications

### For Marketers

**Evidence-Based Persuasion**:
1. Use research-backed biases (not folk psychology)
2. A/B test applications (don't assume)
3. Measure effect sizes (not just significance)
4. Consider boundary conditions (context matters)
5. Ethical application (long-term trust)

**Red Flags**:
- If you wouldn't want family subjected to it
- If you're hiding the tactic
- If it exploits vulnerability
- If claims are exaggerated

### For Consumers

**Research-Based Protection**:
1. **Awareness**: Study common biases
2. **Systematic thinking**: Use checklists/frameworks
3. **Outside view**: Consult others, statistics
4. **Pre-commitment**: Decide criteria beforehand
5. **Delay**: Wait 24 hours for major decisions

**Debiasing Techniques**:
- Consider the opposite
- Seek disconfirming evidence
- Use base rates
- Ignore sunk costs
- Calculate expected value
