# Commitment Psychology Research

## Scientific Foundation of Commitment & Consistency

---

## Part 1: Foundational Research

### The Foot-in-the-Door Technique (Freedman & Fraser, 1966)

**Study Overview:**

**Researchers:** Jonathan Freedman & Scott Fraser, Stanford University

**Question:** Does a small initial request increase compliance with a larger subsequent request?

**Methodology:**

**Experiment 1: "Drive Safely" Campaign**

**Setup:**
- Residential neighborhoods in Palo Alto, California
- Two groups of homeowners

**Group 1: Small Request First (Foot-in-the-Door)**
- Week 1: Asked to display small 3-inch "Be a Safe Driver" window sticker
- Nearly 100% agreed (tiny, reasonable request)
- Week 2: Asked to install large, ugly "Drive Safely" sign in front yard (5ft × 3ft, blocks view)
- **Result: 76% agreed** to large sign

**Group 2: Large Request Only (Control)**
- Asked directly to install large ugly sign
- **Result: 17% agreed**

**Key Finding:**
Prior small commitment increased compliance by **4.5x** (76% vs 17%)

---

**Experiment 2: "Keep California Beautiful"**

**Setup:**
Similar methodology, different cause

**Conditions tested:**
1. Same cause (beautification → beautification): 50% compliance
2. Different cause (safe driving → beautification): 43% compliance
3. No prior request: 17% compliance

**Finding:**
- Foot-in-the-door works even across different causes
- Main factor: Establishing identity as "civic-minded person"

---

**Theoretical Explanation:**

**Self-Perception Theory (Bem, 1972):**
When people comply with small request, they infer:
> "I did that voluntarily, so I must be the kind of person who cares about [cause]"

When larger request comes:
> "I'm that kind of person, so I should say yes to be consistent with my self-concept"

**Mechanism:**
Small commitment → Self-perception change → Identity formation → Consistency drive → Large compliance

---

**Marketing Implications:**

**Traditional approach (direct ask):**
"Buy our $1,000 product" → 2% conversion

**Foot-in-the-door approach:**
1. "Download free guide?" → 40% yes
2. "Join free email course?" → 60% of downloaders = 24% total
3. "Attend free webinar?" → 50% of course subscribers = 12% total
4. "Try free trial?" → 40% of webinar attendees = 4.8% total
5. "Buy $1,000 product?" → 30% of trial users = 1.44% total

**But:** Those 1.44% are highly committed (survived 5-step ladder)
- Higher lifetime value
- Lower churn
- More referrals

**Key insight:** Lower initial conversion but higher quality customers

---

### Cognitive Dissonance Theory (Festinger, 1957)

**Study Overview:**

**Researcher:** Leon Festinger, Stanford University

**Core Theory:**
When beliefs and actions contradict, psychological discomfort (dissonance) arises. To reduce dissonance, people change beliefs to match actions.

---

**The $1 vs $20 Experiment (Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959)**

**Setup:**
- Participants do extremely boring task (turning pegs for 1 hour)
- Then asked to lie to next participant: "Tell them the task was interesting and enjoyable"
- Payment for lying varied by condition

**Conditions:**

**Group A: Paid $20 to lie**
**Group B: Paid $1 to lie**
**Control: No lie, no payment**

**Measured:** Did participants actually change their opinion about the boring task?

---

**Predictions:**

**Behaviorist theory (wrong):**
- Bigger reward ($20) → more attitude change
- Reinforcement drives behavior

**Cognitive dissonance theory (correct):**
- Smaller reward ($1) → more attitude change
- Insufficient justification → need to justify behavior internally

---

**Results:**

**Task enjoyment ratings (1-10 scale):**

**Control group (no lie):** 2.5/10 (baseline - task was boring)

**$20 group:** 2.8/10 (still thought task was boring)
- Internal justification: "I said it was fun because they paid me $20"
- No dissonance (adequate external justification)

**$1 group:** 5.8/10 (actually believed task became more interesting!)
- Internal justification needed: "Why did I lie for just $1? The task must have actually been somewhat interesting"
- High dissonance (inadequate external justification)
- Changed attitude to reduce dissonance

---

**Key Finding:**
**Less justification = more attitude change**

People need to justify their actions. Without external justification (like big payment), they create internal justification (changing beliefs).

---

**Marketing Application: Effort Justification**

**Low-effort onboarding (high churn):**
```
Click button → instant access
Effort: 0 minutes
Free trial → Paid conversion: 15%
```

**High-effort onboarding (low churn):**
```
1. Fill detailed profile (5 min)
2. Complete tutorial (15 min)
3. Set up first project (30 min)
4. Customize settings (10 min)
Total effort: 60 minutes

Free trial → Paid conversion: 35%
```

**Why it works:**
- Cognitive dissonance: "Why did I invest 60 minutes if this wasn't valuable?"
- Internal justification: "It must be good - I put in significant effort"
- Self-perception: "I'm invested in this tool"
- Consistency: "I should continue using what I invested time in"

---

**Hazing Research (Aronson & Mills, 1959):**

**Setup:**
Women join discussion group, but must pass "initiation"

**Conditions:**
- **Severe initiation:** Embarrassing, difficult task to join
- **Mild initiation:** Easy task to join
- **No initiation:** Join directly

**Measured:** How much they valued the group

**Results:**
- **Severe initiation:** Rated group highly valuable (8.2/10)
- **Mild initiation:** Moderate value (6.3/10)
- **No initiation:** Low value (5.1/10)

**Reality:** The discussion group was intentionally boring!

**Explanation:**
- High effort → cognitive dissonance ("Why did I go through that hard initiation?")
- Justification → "The group must be valuable"
- **Effort = perceived value**

---

**Business application:**
- Application process (vs. instant signup) → higher perceived value
- Challenging onboarding → higher commitment
- "Exclusive" access (must qualify) → stronger attachment

**Examples:**
- McKinsey: Grueling interview process → employees highly committed
- CrossFit: Difficult workouts → cult-like community loyalty
- Ivy League: Hard to get in → strong alumni networks

---

## Part 2: Written Commitment Research

### The Power of Writing It Down

**Beach Thief Experiment (Moriarty, 1975)**

**Setup:**
- Researcher places radio on beach towel
- Researcher leaves (goes for walk)
- Confederate "thief" steals radio in plain view
- **Question:** Will bystanders intervene?

**Conditions:**

**Control (no commitment):**
- Researcher just leaves, no interaction with nearby bystander
- **Result:** 20% of bystanders intervened to stop theft

**Verbal commitment:**
- Researcher asks nearby bystander: "Could you watch my things?"
- Bystander says "yes" (verbal commitment)
- **Result:** 95% intervened to stop theft!

**Key finding:**
Verbal commitment increased intervention rate by **4.75x** (95% vs 20%)

---

**Why it worked:**

**1. Commitment made**
Saying "yes" creates obligation

**2. Public accountability**
Another person knows about commitment

**3. Consistency drive**
Not intervening = inconsistent with stated commitment = threat to self-image

**4. Social pressure**
Breaking commitment to another person = social consequence

---

**Extension: Written Commitment (Theoretical)**

If researcher had asked bystander to write:
> "I, [name], commit to watching these belongings"

Expected result: **98-100% intervention**

**Why writing is more powerful:**
- Physical effort invested
- Tangible evidence of commitment
- Can't deny it later ("Did I say that?" doesn't work with writing)
- Active construction (own words)
- Retrieval cue (seeing written commitment triggers consistency)

---

**Marketing Application: Goal Documentation**

**Study (Matthews, 2015):**

**Compared goal achievement across 5 groups:**

**Group 1:** Think about goals (no writing)
- Achievement rate: **43%**

**Group 2:** Write down goals
- Achievement rate: **61%** (+42% vs Group 1)

**Group 3:** Write goals + action commitments
- Achievement rate: **64%**

**Group 4:** Write goals + actions + share with friend
- Achievement rate: **68%**

**Group 5:** Write goals + actions + share + weekly progress updates to friend
- Achievement rate: **76%** (+77% vs Group 1!)

**Key findings:**
1. Writing increases achievement by 42%
2. Public commitment (sharing) adds another 11%
3. Accountability (updates) adds final 12%
4. **Best: Written + Public + Accountability = 76% success rate**

---

**Business application: Onboarding goal setting**

**Weak approach:**
```
"What do you want to achieve?"
[Customer thinks but doesn't write]
Sign up complete
```

**Strong approach:**
```
"Let's document your goals"

Step 1: "What's your primary goal?"
[Write in text box]

Step 2: "Why is this important to you?"
[Write reasons]

Step 3: "By when do you want to achieve this?"
[Write date]

Step 4: "What's your first action?"
[Write specific action]

Step 5: "Share your commitment"
[Optional: Post to social media]

Step 6: Weekly email:
"You committed to [goal] by [date]. Here's your progress: [X%]"
```

**Result:**
- Written commitment: Higher engagement
- Specific deadline: Urgency created
- Public sharing: Social accountability
- Weekly reminders: Consistency reinforced
- **Retention: +40-60%**

---

### Public vs. Private Commitments

**Research (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955)**

**Setup:**
Visual perception task (which line is longer?)

**Conditions:**

**Private commitment:**
- Participant writes answer privately
- No one else sees
- Then group discussion
- Can change answer

**Public commitment:**
- Participant states answer publicly to group
- Everyone hears
- Then group discussion
- Can change answer

**Group pressure introduced:**
Confederates give obviously wrong answer (social pressure to conform)

---

**Results:**

**Private commitment group:**
- Changed answer when group disagreed: 58%
- Moderate consistency drive

**Public commitment group:**
- Changed answer when group disagreed: 12%
- **Strong consistency drive (5x more consistent than private)**

**Key finding:**
Public commitments are 5x more resistant to change than private commitments

---

**Why public is more powerful:**

**1. Reputation at stake**
- Others know what you committed to
- Changing = looking inconsistent/unreliable
- Social cost of inconsistency

**2. Multiple witnesses**
- Can't pretend it didn't happen
- Accountability to group, not just self

**3. Identity crystallization**
- Public statement = declaring "this is who I am"
- Stronger self-concept formation

**4. Social consequences**
- Private: Only you know you broke commitment
- Public: Others will notice and may comment/judge

---

**Marketing Application: Public Commitments**

**Case Study: DietBet (weight loss betting platform)**

**Mechanism:**
1. User sets weight loss goal publicly
2. Bets money on achieving goal
3. Posts to social media (public commitment)
4. Friends/family see commitment
5. Weekly weigh-ins (public accountability)

**Results:**
- Private goal + money: 65% achieve goal
- Public goal + money: 82% achieve goal (+26%)
- Public + money + friend participation: 91% achieve goal (+40%)

**Why it works:**
- Financial commitment (loss aversion)
- Public commitment (social accountability)
- Friend involvement (relationship accountability)
- **Triple consistency drive**

---

**Business applications:**

**1. Social media goal sharing:**
```
After signup/purchase:
"Announce your commitment to your network!"

[Pre-filled post]
"I just joined [Product] to [achieve goal]! Follow my journey. #commitment"

[One-click share]
```

**2. Community public commitments:**
```
Weekly thread:
"What's your commitment for this week?"

Members post publicly:
"I commit to [specific action] by Friday"

Next week:
"Did you complete your commitment? Share results!"
```

**3. Leaderboard/public progress:**
```
Dashboard shows:
- Your streak: 47 days 🔥
- Leaderboard position: #23
- Your public profile: [Name]'s progress

Quitting = visible drop from leaderboard (social consequence)
```

---

## Part 3: Identity & Self-Perception

### Voter Study (Tybout & Yalch, 1980)

**Setup:**
Day before election, researchers contacted registered voters

**Conditions:**

**Group A - Behavioral question:**
> "Will you vote tomorrow?"

**Group B - Identity question:**
> "How important is it to you to be a voter?"
> "Do you consider yourself someone who participates in elections?"

**Both groups:** Same conversation length, same politeness

---

**Results:**

**Group A (behavior):** 64% actually voted
- Baseline participation rate

**Group B (identity):** 87% actually voted
- **+36% increase from identity framing!**

**Key finding:**
Identity question → stronger commitment than behavioral question

---

**Why identity is more powerful:**

**Behavior question activates:**
- Intention ("Will I vote?")
- Situational factors ("Do I have time?")
- Weak commitment

**Identity question activates:**
- Self-concept ("Am I a voter?")
- Core values ("Is voting part of who I am?")
- Strong commitment (must act consistently with identity)

**Psychological mechanism:**

After answering identity question:
> "I said being a voter is important to me, and that I participate in elections"

On election day:
> "Not voting would contradict what I said about my identity"
> "I need to vote to be consistent with who I said I am"

**Identity > Behavior**

---

**Marketing Application: Identity Activation**

**Weak (behavior-based):**
```
"Do you want to buy our fitness program?"
→ Focuses on action (buying)
→ Easy to say no
→ Low commitment
```

**Strong (identity-based):**
```
"Do you see yourself as someone who prioritizes health and fitness?"
[Customer: "Yes"]

"Great! Then our program is perfect for people like you who take their health seriously..."
→ Activates identity
→ Saying no = contradicting stated identity
→ High commitment
```

---

**Case Study: Apple "I'm a Mac" Campaign**

**Traditional approach:**
"Mac computers have better features"
→ Rational argument
→ Moderate effectiveness

**Apple's identity approach:**
"I'm a Mac" (vs "I'm a PC")
→ Identity positioning
→ Buying Mac = identity statement
→ Massive effectiveness

**Why it worked:**
- Not about features, about who you are
- "I'm a Mac" person = creative, cool, innovative
- "I'm a PC" person = boring, corporate, outdated
- Purchase becomes identity expression
- **Consistency:** Once you see yourself as "Mac person," buying PC is inconsistent

**Result:**
- Market share increased from 2% to 13% during campaign (2006-2009)
- Premium pricing maintained (identity = willing to pay more)
- Brand loyalty cult-like (identity defense)

---

## Part 4: Consistency Escalation

### Low-Ball Technique (Cialdini et al., 1978)

**Setup:**
Car dealership experiment

**Mechanism:**
1. Customer agrees to buy car at good price
2. Customer fills out paperwork (commitment)
3. Salesperson "discovers" calculation error
4. Real price is $400 higher
5. Will customer still buy?

---

**Conditions:**

**Control group (honest pricing):**
- Told real price upfront
- Asked to buy
- **Result: 31% purchased**

**Low-ball group (bait-and-switch):**
- Told low price, agreed
- Filled out paperwork (commitment)
- Price increased $400
- **Result: 57% still purchased** (despite higher final price!)

**Key finding:**
Initial commitment (even at false price) increased compliance by 84% (57% vs 31%)

---

**Why it worked:**

**1. Initial commitment made**
Agreed to buy, started paperwork

**2. Psychological investment**
Already mentally "owns" car

**3. Consistency drive**
"I already decided to buy this car. Backing out now = inconsistent"

**4. Justification shift**
Initial reason (price) removed, but brain finds new reasons:
"I really like this car" (price becomes secondary)

**5. Sunk cost**
Time invested in paperwork

---

**Ethical consideration:**
Low-ball is manipulative and often illegal (deceptive advertising). Don't use exact technique.

**Ethical alternative: Progressive value revelation**
1. Initial offer (fair, honest)
2. Customer commits
3. Reveal additional value (bonuses, extras)
4. Build commitment through added value (not deception)

---

**Ethical application: SaaS onboarding**

```
Step 1: Sign up for free trial (commitment)

Step 2: Complete onboarding (investment)

Step 3: Experience value (legitimize commitment)

Step 4: Reveal premium features
"You've been using [basic features]. Ready to unlock [advanced features]?"

Step 5: Consistency drives upgrade
"I'm already using this daily. Upgrading makes sense."
```

**Key difference:**
- Value is real (not fake like low-ball)
- Commitment built through genuine experience
- Upgrade is logical progression (not deception)

---

### Sunk Cost Escalation (Arkes & Blumer, 1985)

**Study:**

**Setup:**
Participants offered two ski trip packages:

**Scenario A:**
- Bought $50 ski trip ticket last month
- Now better $25 ski trip available (different location)
- Which trip to take?

**Scenario B:**
- Bought $100 ski trip ticket last month
- Now better $25 ski trip available (different location)
- Which trip to take?

**Rational decision:**
- Past cost is "sunk" (can't recover)
- Should choose best trip regardless of past investment
- $25 trip is clearly better (in both scenarios)

---

**Results:**

**Scenario A ($50 sunk cost):**
- 38% chose worse expensive trip (sunk cost fallacy)

**Scenario B ($100 sunk cost):**
- 61% chose worse expensive trip
- Higher sunk cost = stronger commitment

**Key finding:**
Larger past investment → more likely to continue (even when irrational)

---

**Psychological mechanism:**

**Consistency drive:**
"I invested $100, so this trip must be worthwhile"

**Loss aversion:**
Switching = "wasting" $100 (feels like loss)

**Ego protection:**
Admitting mistake = psychological pain
Continuing = "validating" past decision

---

**Marketing Application:**

**Subscription services:**

**Customer thinking:**
"I've paid for 6 months ($600 invested)"
"Canceling now = wasting that investment"
"I should keep using it to justify the cost"

**Business strategy:**
- Annual plans (larger sunk cost → harder to cancel)
- Track cumulative investment ("You've invested $2,400 over 2 years")
- Remind of progress ("Don't lose your 500-day streak!")

---

**Ethical use:**

✅ **Good:** Remind customers of genuine value received
```
"You've achieved [X results] using our platform.
You've invested [Y time/money].
Continue to [achieve more]?"
```

❌ **Bad:** Guilt-trip about sunk cost without value
```
"You've paid us $1,000.
You'd waste that money by canceling.
Don't be someone who quits."
```

**Ethical guideline:**
Use sunk cost reminder only when:
1. Customer has received real value
2. Continuing will provide more value
3. You're helping them achieve their goals (not just keeping revenue)

---

## Part 5: Social Consistency

### Group Commitment Studies

**Lewin's Food Habits Study (1943)**

**Context:** WWII food rationing - government wanted households to eat less desirable meats (organ meats)

**Conditions:**

**Group A - Lecture approach:**
- Expert nutritionist gave compelling lecture
- Explained benefits of organ meats
- Provided recipes
- Urged women to serve organ meats
- **Result: 3% actually served organ meats**

**Group B - Group discussion + public commitment:**
- Small group discussion about organ meats
- Facilitator asked: "Who's willing to try serving organ meats this week?"
- Women raised hands (public commitment)
- **Result: 32% actually served organ meats**

**Key finding:**
Public group commitment 10x more effective than expert persuasion (32% vs 3%)

---

**Why group commitment works:**

**1. Public accountability**
Others in group know who committed

**2. Social proof**
"Others are doing it, I should too"

**3. Reciprocal commitment**
"They committed, so should I"

**4. Group identity**
"We're all in this together"

**5. Consistency to group**
Breaking commitment = letting group down

---

**Modern application: Cohort-based courses**

**Individual learning (no group):**
- Completion rate: 5-15%
- Weak commitment
- Easy to quit (no one watching)

**Cohort-based learning:**
- Small groups (20-30 students)
- Weekly group calls
- Public progress sharing
- Peer accountability
- **Completion rate: 60-85%** (4-17x higher!)

**Mechanisms:**
- Public commitment (goals shared with cohort)
- Social accountability (peers see progress)
- Group identity ("my cohort")
- Reciprocal obligation ("others are showing up, I should too")

---

## Part 6: Commitment Timing

### When to Ask for Commitment

**Research (Cialdini & Sagarin, 2005)**

**Question:** Does timing of commitment request matter?

**Study:**
Restaurant reservation study

**Conditions:**

**Standard approach:**
Receptionist: "Please call if you need to cancel"
No commitment requested
**No-show rate: 30%**

**Commitment approach:**
Receptionist: "Will you please call if you need to cancel?"
**[WAIT FOR ANSWER - customer says "yes"]**
**No-show rate: 10%**

**Key finding:**
- Getting explicit "yes" reduced no-shows by 67%
- Critical: Must wait for customer to say "yes" (not just state request)

---

**Why waiting for confirmation matters:**

**Without wait:**
"Please call if you cancel" = instruction (not commitment)

**With wait:**
"Will you call?" → [Wait] → "Yes" = commitment
Customer must actively agree (self-commitment)

---

**Marketing application: Email confirmations**

**Weak:**
```
"We'll send you weekly tips."
[No response required]
```

**Strong:**
```
"Want weekly tips? Reply YES to confirm."
[Requires active commitment]
→ Higher engagement (committed vs. passive)
```

**Webinar registrations:**

**Weak:**
Click button → registered (passive)

**Strong:**
```
1. Click button
2. "Confirm attendance: Will you be there?" [YES/NO buttons]
3. "Add to calendar" [Active step]
4. Day before: "You said YES. See you tomorrow!"
→ Attendance rate: +45%
```

---
