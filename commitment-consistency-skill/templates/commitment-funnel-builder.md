# Commitment Funnel Builder

## Strategic Template for Building Commitment-Based Customer Journey

---

## Introduction: The Commitment Funnel Framework

**What is a commitment funnel?**
A step-by-step customer journey where each action builds on the previous commitment, creating an escalating ladder of engagement.

**Why you need one:**
- Increases conversion rates (2-5x vs. direct ask)
- Builds stronger customer relationships
- Creates psychological ownership before purchase
- Reduces churn (committed customers stay longer)

**How to use this template:**
1. Map your current funnel
2. Identify commitment gaps
3. Add micro-commitment steps
4. Implement consistency triggers
5. Track and optimize
