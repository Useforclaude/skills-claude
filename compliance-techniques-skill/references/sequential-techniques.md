# Sequential Compliance Techniques

## Overview

Sequential techniques use a series of requests (typically 2) to achieve compliance with a target request. The key principle: how you frame the first request dramatically affects compliance with the second.

---

## 1. Foot-in-the-Door (FITD)

### Mechanism
Start with a small, nearly impossible-to-refuse request. After acceptance, follow up with the target (larger) request. Initial compliance increases likelihood of subsequent compliance.

### Psychology
- **Self-Perception Theory**: "I helped before, therefore I'm a helpful person"
- **Commitment Consistency**: Desire to appear consistent with past behavior
- **Cognitive Dissonance**: Refusing second request contradicts helpful self-image

### Research Base

**Original Study (Freedman & Fraser, 1966):**
- **Setup**: Homeowners asked to place small sign in window, then later asked for large ugly sign in yard
- **Results**: 76% of small-sign group agreed to large sign vs. 17% control
- **Effect Size**: 4.5x increase in compliance

**Burger (1999) Meta-Analysis:**
- **Studies Analyzed**: 120+ experiments
- **Average Effect Size**: d = 0.33 (small to medium)
- **Success Rate**: Increases compliance 10-30% on average
- **Optimal Conditions**:
  - Delay of 1-7 days between requests (1-3 days optimal)
  - Initial request requires active behavior (not just agreement)
  - Both requests perceived as related
  - Same requestor for both

### Implementation Guidelines

**Initial Request Design:**
- Size: 10-30% of final request cost/effort
- Completion Time: 1-10 minutes ideal
- Difficulty: Easy enough for 80%+ compliance
- Relevance: Clearly related to final request (not always required)

**Optimal Timing:**
- **Too Soon** (< 1 day): Appears manipulative, triggers reactance
- **Too Late** (> 2 weeks): Initial commitment fades
- **Sweet Spot**: 1-3 days for small requests, 3-7 days for larger initial requests

**Request Progression:**
- Initial: "Can you sign this petition for better recycling?"
- Follow-up: "Would you be willing to volunteer 2 hours/month for our recycling program?"

### Real-World Examples

**Nonprofit Fundraising:**
```
Week 1: "Would you take this awareness sticker?"
Week 2: "Since you support our cause, would you donate $25?"
Result: 45% donation rate vs. 15% direct ask
```

**Software/SaaS:**
```
Day 0: "Create a free account" (no credit card)
Day 3: "Try our premium features for 7 days"
Day 10: "Continue with paid plan at $29/month"
Result: 23% conversion vs. 8% direct-to-paid
```

**Gym Membership:**
```
Visit 1: "Try this free 1-day pass"
Visit 2: "How about a free week trial?"
Visit 3: "Ready to join with our $39/month plan?"
Result: 31% membership vs. 9% direct signup
```

**Environmental Behavior:**
```
Week 1: "Will you display this energy-saving sticker?"
Week 3: "Can you reduce thermostat by 2 degrees?"
Result: 68% compliance vs. 23% direct ask
```

### Success Factors

**Enhancers:**
- Active behavior for initial request (vs. passive agreement)
- Public initial commitment (vs. private)
- Labeling ("You're a helpful person")
- Same requestor for both asks
- Requests perceived as related

**Inhibitors:**
- Large initial request (reduces initial compliance)
- Too-short delay (appears manipulative)
- Too-long delay (commitment fades)
- Different requestors
- Suspicious targets

### Common Mistakes

1. **Initial Request Too Large**: Should be nearly automatic yes
2. **No Clear Connection**: Requests should logically relate
3. **Rushing Second Request**: Need time for self-perception shift
4. **Inconsistent Messaging**: Brand/tone should match between requests
5. **Ignoring Resistance**: If they seem hesitant on small ask, recalibrate

### Ethical Considerations

**Acceptable Uses:**
- Building genuine engagement progressively
- Reducing overwhelm from large initial ask
- Helping people align actions with values

**Problematic Uses:**
- Tricking into unwanted subscriptions
- Exploiting initial goodwill for profit
- Creating obligation through tiny favors

**Ethical Checklist:**
- [ ] Would target benefit from final request?
- [ ] Is relationship goal long-term?
- [ ] Is initial request valuable on its own?
- [ ] Can target easily decline second request?

## 2. Door-in-the-Face (DITF)

### Mechanism
Start with a deliberately large, likely-to-be-refused request. After refusal, present the target (smaller) request. The contrast makes the second request seem more reasonable, and reciprocal concessions pressure compliance.

### Psychology
- **Reciprocal Concessions**: You "gave in" by lowering your request; they feel obligated to give in by agreeing
- **Contrast Principle**: Second request seems smaller by comparison
- **Guilt Reduction**: Agreeing to smaller request reduces guilt from refusing first
- **Perceptual Contrast**: Sequential comparison distorts size perception

### Research Base

**Original Study (Cialdini et al., 1975):**
- **Setup**: College students asked to volunteer 2 years as juvenile counselor, then (after refusal) asked for 2-hour trip to zoo
- **Results**: 50% agreed to zoo trip vs. 17% control
- **Effect Size**: 3x increase in compliance

**O'Keefe & Hale (1998) Meta-Analysis:**
- **Studies**: 42 experiments
- **Average Effect Size**: d = 0.36 (medium)
- **Success Factors**:
  - Same person making both requests (critical)
  - Immediate follow-up (within seconds to minutes)
  - Prosocial requests (vs. self-serving)
  - Larger initial-to-target request ratio

### Implementation Guidelines

**Initial Request Design:**
- Size: 2-5x the target request (cost, time, effort)
- Must be plausible but clearly too large
- Should be refused but not offensive
- Same category/domain as target request

**Optimal Timing:**
- **Immediate Follow-up**: Best results within 30 seconds of refusal
- **Same Conversation**: Both requests in single interaction
- **No Cooling Period**: Delay reduces effectiveness dramatically

**Request Ratio:**
- **Too Similar** (1.5x): Insufficient contrast
- **Optimal** (2-3x): Clear concession perceived
- **Too Large** (10x+): Appears unreasonable, damages credibility

### Real-World Examples

**Sales Negotiation:**
```
Seller: "The premium package is $5,000"
Buyer: "That's too much"
Seller: "I understand. How about our standard package at $2,000?"
Result: 65% acceptance vs. 40% presenting $2,000 directly
```

**Parenting:**
```
Teen: "Can I stay out until 2 AM?"
Parent: "No"
Teen: "How about midnight?"
Parent: "...okay"
Result: Teen gets later curfew than likely granted if asked directly
```

**Charitable Donations:**
```
Request 1: "Would you donate $500 to our cause?"
Donor: "I can't afford that"
Request 2: "I understand. Even $50 would make a difference"
Result: 42% donate vs. 18% direct $50 ask (and higher average amount)
```

**B2B Sales:**
```
Initial: "Our enterprise solution is $100K/year"
Client: "Way out of budget"
Counter: "We have a professional tier at $25K/year that covers your key needs"
Result: 55% conversion vs. 28% leading with $25K offer
```

**Negotiating Time Off:**
```
Employee: "I'd like to take 3 weeks off next month"
Manager: "That's not possible"
Employee: "Would 10 days work?"
Result: More likely than asking for 10 days initially
```

### Success Factors

**Enhancers:**
- Same requestor for both asks (critical!)
- Immediate sequence (no delay)
- Prosocial/altruistic requests
- Face-to-face communication
- Initial request plausible (not absurd)

**Inhibitors:**
- Different people making requests
- Delay between requests
- Self-serving requests
- Initial request too extreme (insults intelligence)
- Suspicious targets who recognize technique

### Common Mistakes

1. **Initial Request Insulting**: Should be large but not ridiculous
2. **Switching Requestors**: Ruins reciprocity dynamic
3. **Delaying Second Request**: Must be immediate
4. **Wrong Category**: Requests should be same type
5. **Transparent Manipulation**: Don't make it obvious

### Defense Strategies

**Recognition Signs:**
- Suspiciously large initial request
- Immediate "compromise" offer after refusal
- Requests seem pre-planned in sequence

**Counter-tactics:**
- Evaluate second request independently of first
- Compare to market rates, not to inflated initial offer
- Take time before responding: "Let me think about it"
- Explicitly acknowledge the technique: "I see what you're doing"

### Ethical Considerations

**Acceptable Uses:**
- Legitimate negotiation with genuine options
- Finding mutually beneficial compromise
- Testing willingness with sincere fallback options

**Problematic Uses:**
- Fake initial offers designed only to anchor
- Manipulating people into unwanted agreements
- Exploiting obligation in unequal power dynamics

**Ethical Checklist:**
- [ ] Is initial request a genuine possibility?
- [ ] Would you accept it if they agreed?
- [ ] Is target request still beneficial to them?
- [ ] Are you open to genuine negotiation?

## 3. Low-Ball Technique

### Mechanism
Secure agreement to an attractive offer, then reveal additional costs or remove benefits. Initial commitment makes people reluctant to back out, even when deal worsens.

### Psychology
- **Commitment Consistency**: Hard to back out after public/mental commitment
- **Cognitive Dissonance**: Backing out conflicts with committed identity
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Already invested mental energy in decision
- **Self-Justification**: Generated reasons to buy persist after price increase
- **Social Image**: Don't want to appear fickle or indecisive

### Research Base

**Original Study (Cialdini et al., 1978):**
- **Setup**: Students agreed to participate in 7 AM study, then told the time (vs. control told time upfront)
- **Results**: 53% showed up vs. 31% control
- **Effect Size**: 70% increase in follow-through

**Burger & Petty (1981):**
- **Setup**: Agreed to buy cupcakes, then told they need to also buy drinks
- **Results**: 73% still bought vs. 40% when told upfront
- **Key Finding**: Effect persists even when informed it's a technique

### Implementation Guidelines

**Phase 1: Initial Offer**
- Design genuinely attractive initial terms
- Secure verbal or written agreement
- Allow target to mentally commit
- Let them start generating purchase justifications

**Phase 2: Cost Revelation**
- Introduce as "discovered" additional cost (not deception)
- Keep increase to 15-30% of original price
- Provide plausible reason (not your fault)
- Offer renewed choice (don't force)

**Optimal Timing:**
- **Agreement to Revelation**: Minutes to hours
- **Too Quick**: Appears planned (backfires)
- **Too Slow**: More likely to trigger cancellation

### Real-World Examples

**Car Sales (Classic Example):**
```
Phase 1: "This car is $25,000, and we'll give you $8,000 for your trade-in"
[Customer does paperwork, imagines ownership]
Phase 2: "Manager says we can only offer $6,000 for trade-in"
Result: 70% still buy vs. 45% offering $27,000 net upfront
```

**Software/SaaS:**
```
Phase 1: "Sign up for Pro Plan at $29/month"
[User enters credit card, sets up account]
Phase 2: "Pro Plan requires minimum 5 user seats at $29 each"
Result: 58% continue vs. 35% transparent pricing
```

**Real Estate:**
```
Phase 1: "House listed at $400K, seller accepts your offer"
[Buyer emotionally invested, tells family]
Phase 2: "Inspection revealed $15K in repairs needed"
Result: 82% still close vs. ~60% if listed at $415K
```

**Event Tickets:**
```
Phase 1: "Concert ticket $100"
[User selects seat, adds to cart]
Phase 2: "$25 service fee + $10 delivery at checkout"
Result: 67% complete purchase vs. 48% if shown upfront
```

### Success Factors

**Enhancers:**
- Strong initial commitment (written, public)
- Time to generate purchase justifications
- Plausible reason for cost increase
- Target has told others about decision
- Significant effort already invested

**Inhibitors:**
- Obvious bait-and-switch
- Very large cost increases (>50%)
- Immediate revelation (no commitment time)
- Easy alternatives available
- Sophisticated/wary targets

### Common Mistakes

1. **Too-Obvious Manipulation**: Must seem like unexpected discovery
2. **Massive Increases**: Keep to 15-30% to maintain plausibility
3. **Immediate Reveal**: Need time for mental commitment to form
4. **No Justification**: Must explain why cost changed
5. **Blocking Exit**: Must allow backing out (even if discouraged)

### Defense Strategies

**Recognition Signs:**
- Price seems too good to be true initially
- "Discovered" fees appear at last minute
- High-pressure to commit before full information
- Complicated pricing structures

**Counter-tactics:**
- Get all costs in writing before commitment
- Ask explicitly: "Are there any other fees?"
- Walk away if significant costs added
- Report to authorities if fraudulent
- Use cooling-off periods (24-48 hours)

### Legal & Ethical Issues

**Legal Concerns:**
- Illegal in many jurisdictions if deceptive
- Requires disclosure of all material costs
- Consumer protection laws may apply
- FTC regulations for online sales

**Ethical Red Flags:**
- Planned cost increases (vs. genuine discoveries)
- Hidden fees in fine print
- No option to cancel without penalty
- Targeting vulnerable populations

**When It's Ethical:**
- Genuine unforeseen costs (real repairs found)
- Full disclosure before final commitment
- Easy, no-penalty cancellation available
- Cost increase clearly explained

**When It's Unethical:**
- Planned bait-and-switch strategy
- Hidden mandatory fees
- Psychological pressure to prevent backing out
- No legitimate reason for cost change

## 4. That's-Not-All Technique (TNA)

### Mechanism
Present an offer, then improve it before the target responds. Adding bonuses or reducing price creates reciprocity pressure and perceived deal value.

### Psychology
- **Reciprocity Norm**: Gift/improvement triggers obligation
- **Perceived Value**: Enhancement feels like special treatment
- **Contrast Effect**: Deal seems better after improvement
- **Perceptual Momentum**: Yes already forming in mind

### Research Base

**Original Study (Burger, 1986):**
- **Setup**: Cupcake sale - offered at $0.75, then immediately added cookies "and we'll throw in cookies" vs. offering both for $0.75 upfront
- **Results**: 73% bought (TNA) vs. 40% (control)
- **Effect Size**: 82% increase in sales

**Key Findings:**
- Works best when enhancement added before response
- Effect disappears if target says "no" first
- Doesn't matter if price reduction or bonus addition
- Face-to-face more effective than written

### Implementation Guidelines

**Timing Is Critical:**
```
CORRECT Sequence:
1. Present initial offer
2. Pause (2-3 seconds, not long enough to respond)
3. Add enhancement: "And I'll throw in..."
4. Allow response

INCORRECT Sequence:
1. Present offer
2. Target says "no"
3. Add enhancement ← TOO LATE (this is DITF, not TNA)
```

**Enhancement Design:**
- Value: 15-30% of base offer
- Type: Bonus item or price reduction
- Timing: Immediate (within 5 seconds of initial offer)
- Delivery: Enthusiastic, as if doing favor

### Real-World Examples

**Infomercial Classic:**
```
"This amazing knife set is just $99.99...
But wait! If you call in the next 10 minutes,
we'll throw in this cutting board absolutely free!"
Result: 68% orders vs. 41% offering both upfront
```

**Retail Sales:**
```
Salesperson: "This jacket is $200"
[2-second pause]
Salesperson: "Actually, we're running a promotion - I can give you 20% off today"
Result: 55% purchase vs. 38% advertised sale price
```

**Restaurant Upselling:**
```
Server: "The steak dinner is $35"
[brief pause]
Server: "And that comes with a free appetizer tonight"
Result: 43% order steak vs. 27% when advertised upfront
```

**B2B Software:**
```
Rep: "Our professional plan is $500/month"
[pause]
Rep: "And I can include our premium support package at no extra cost for the first year"
Result: 61% conversion vs. 44% including support in base offer
```

**Online Shopping:**
```
Checkout page shows: "$89.99"
After adding to cart: "Promo applied! Now only $79.99 + free shipping!"
Result: 52% complete checkout vs. 39% showing $79.99 upfront
```

### Success Factors

**Enhancers:**
- Enhancement before target responds
- Surprise/spontaneous presentation
- Face-to-face interaction
- Enthusiastic delivery
- Perceived special treatment

**Inhibitors:**
- Target already said "no"
- Enhancement obviously planned
- Written/online presentation (weaker effect)
- Insufficient value added
- Flat/scripted delivery

### Variations

**Price Reduction:**
- "Actually, I can give you 15% off"
- Works well when price is negotiable

**Bonus Addition:**
- "I'll throw in free shipping"
- Works well with fixed-price items

**Service Upgrade:**
- "I'll include premium support"
- Works well for subscriptions

**Time Extension:**
- "I'll extend your trial to 30 days"
- Works well for services

### Common Mistakes

1. **Waiting for "No"**: Must add before response (that's DITF)
2. **Too-Long Pause**: Target starts formulating "no"
3. **Insufficient Value**: Enhancement must be meaningful (15%+)
4. **Obviously Scripted**: Must seem spontaneous
5. **Multiple Additions**: One enhancement is enough

### Combination Strategies

**TNA + Scarcity:**
```
"This laptop is $999... and I'll throw in a free case and mouse.
But this promotion ends at 5 PM today."
Result: Combines reciprocity + urgency
```

**TNA + Authority:**
```
"Our consulting package is $5,000...
and I'm authorized to include our premium audit at no charge."
Result: Combines reciprocity + special treatment
```

**TNA + Social Proof:**
```
"This course is $299... and I'll give you access to our private community
where 500+ students collaborate."
Result: Combines reciprocity + belonging
```

### Ethical Considerations

**Acceptable Uses:**
- Genuine promotional offers
- Real-time pricing flexibility
- Authentic attempt to provide value
- Transparent about standard pricing

**Problematic Uses:**
- Fake "additions" always planned
- Inflated base price to allow "discount"
- Pressure tactics preventing deliberation
- False scarcity claims

**Ethical Guidelines:**
- Make offer genuine (not always planned)
- Ensure added value is real
- Allow time for consideration
- Be honest about standard pricing
- Don't combine with hard pressure tactics

## 5. Even-a-Penny-Will-Help Technique

### Mechanism
Legitimize small contributions by explicitly mentioning that even minimal amounts are acceptable. Removes the excuse "I can't afford to give much" and increases participation.

### Psychology
- **Excuse Removal**: Can't say amount too small
- **Legitimizing Paltry Contributions**: Small donations socially acceptable
- **Foot-in-Door Element**: Small donation → larger future gifts
- **Self-Perception**: "I'm a donor" identity established
- **Social Norms**: Demonstrates acceptable minimum

### Research Base

**Original Study (Cialdini & Schroeder, 1976):**
- **Setup**: Door-to-door charity asking for donations, half heard "even a penny would help"
- **Results**: 50% donated (treatment) vs. 29% (control)
- **Average Gift**: Same size in both groups (~$1)
- **Key Finding**: Increases participation without reducing gift size

**Regli & Sinclair (2005) Meta-Analysis:**
- **Studies**: 22 experiments
- **Effect Size**: d = 0.31 (small to medium)
- **Success Rate**: 40-80% increase in donor participation
- **Average Gift**: Usually unchanged or slightly increased

### Implementation Guidelines

**Phrasing Options:**

**Classic Format:**
- "Even a dollar would help"
- "Even a penny makes a difference"

**Benefit-Focused:**
- "Even $5 provides a meal for one child"
- "Every dollar funds 10 minutes of research"

**Legitimizing Language:**
- "Whatever you can afford"
- "Any amount is appreciated"
- "No gift is too small"

**Key Principle:** Must explicitly mention small amount, not just say "any amount"

### Real-World Examples

**Nonprofit Fundraising:**
```
Standard: "Would you donate to our cause?"
Result: 28% donate, average gift $25

Enhanced: "Even $1 helps feed a family. Would you donate?"
Result: 52% donate, average gift $24
Net: 86% more total revenue
```

**Crowdfunding:**
```
Campaign 1: "Help us reach our $10,000 goal"
Result: 340 backers, $8,200 raised

Campaign 2: "Even $5 gets you updates and helps us reach our $10,000 goal"
Result: 680 backers, $11,400 raised
Net: 39% overfunding
```

**Street Charity:**
```
Control: "Can you donate to homeless services?"
Treatment: "Even a quarter helps. Can you donate?"
Result: 61% give something vs. 34% control
```

**Online Donations:**
```
Standard button: "Donate Now"
Enhanced button: "Even $3 Makes a Difference - Donate Now"
Result: 44% increase in click-through, same average donation
```

**Membership Drives:**
```
Control: "Join our organization"
Treatment: "Membership starts at just $10/year - every member matters"
Result: 3.2x more signups at all price tiers
```

### Success Factors

**Enhancers:**
- Specific small amount mentioned (not just "any")
- Charitable/prosocial context
- Face-to-face asks (vs. digital)
- Legitimate need communicated
- Follow-up for larger future gifts

**Inhibitors:**
- Commercial/profit context (less effective)
- Wealthy target audience (may backfire)
- Unclear cause or legitimacy
- No specific amount mentioned

### Mechanism Analysis

**Why It Works:**

1. **Removes Minimum Threshold**: People assume there's a "too small" amount
2. **Reduces Comparison Anxiety**: Don't worry if others give more
3. **Lowers Barrier to Entry**: Removes economic excuse
4. **Maintains Self-Image**: Can be "generous" with small gift
5. **Social Proof**: Establishes norm that small gifts are valued

**Why Amount Stays Same:**

- **Self-Esteem**: Most give what they can afford (unchanged)
- **Social Desirability**: Still want to give respectable amount
- **Anchoring**: If mentioned amount is very small ($0.01), people still anchor on reasonable gift
- **Increased Volume**: More small gifts offset by more medium gifts too

### Common Mistakes

1. **Generic "Any Amount"**: Must specify small amount
2. **Too-Large Small Amount**: "$50 would help" defeats purpose
3. **Emphasizing Small Too Much**: Might anchor all gifts downward
4. **Wrong Context**: Less effective for commercial products
5. **No Follow-Up**: Missing opportunity for future larger gifts

### Advanced Applications

**Tiered Approach:**
```
"Even $5 provides one meal...
$25 provides meals for a week...
$100 feeds a family for a month"

Result: More $5 donors, but also more $100+ donors
(reduces middle-tier $25 slightly)
```

**Recurring Donations:**
```
"Even $3/month adds up to feeding 144 meals per year"

Result: 2.1x more recurring donor signups
Lower cancellation rate (less commitment concern)
```

**Foot-in-Door Sequence:**
```
Ask 1: "Even $1 today helps" → 58% give
Wait 2 weeks
Ask 2: "Would you donate $20 to expand your impact?" → 34% of previous donors give
Net: Higher lifetime value per donor
```

### Ethical Considerations

**Appropriate Uses:**
- Legitimate charitable causes
- Genuine need for broad participation
- Transparent about fund usage
- Grateful for all contribution sizes

**Inappropriate Uses:**
- Manipulating people to open wallet, then upselling
- Commercial products (insincere)
- Implying small gifts insufficient while promoting them
- Shaming larger gifts as inadequate

**Best Practices:**
- Honor small gifts genuinely
- Provide meaningful impact statements for all tiers
- Allow easy one-time participation
- Don't pressure for larger gifts immediately
- Report clearly on fund usage

## Comparison Table: Sequential Techniques

| Technique | Setup | Target Request Timing | Best For | Effect Size | Key Psychology |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Foot-in-Door** | Small request first | 1-7 days later | Large behavioral change | d=0.33 (33% increase) | Self-perception consistency |
| **Door-in-Face** | Large request first | Immediate (same conversation) | Negotiation, compromise | d=0.36 (3x vs control) | Reciprocal concessions |
| **Low-Ball** | Attractive offer → worsen | Minutes to hours after agreement | High-commitment purchases | 70% follow-through | Commitment consistency |
