## Part 1: Decision-Making Psychology (System 1 vs System 2)

### 1.1 Dual-Process Theory (Kahneman & Tversky)

**System 1 (Fast Thinking):**
- Automatic, intuitive, emotional
- Operates unconsciously
- Makes snap judgments
- Susceptible to cognitive biases
- **Marketing application:** First impressions, emotional branding, impulse purchases

**System 2 (Slow Thinking):**
- Deliberate, analytical, rational
- Requires conscious effort
- Makes careful decisions
- More accurate but mentally taxing
- **Marketing application:** High-involvement purchases, B2B decisions, complex products

**Research:** Kahneman, D. (2011). "Thinking, Fast and Slow"

**Consumer Implications:**
1. **80% of purchase decisions** are made by System 1 (emotional/intuitive)
2. **System 2 rationalizes** decisions made by System 1 (post-purchase justification)
3. **Cognitive load** pushes consumers toward System 1 (simplicity wins)

### 1.2 Cognitive Load Theory

**Principle:** Excessive information overwhelms decision-making capacity.

**Applications:**
- Limit choices to 3-5 options (choice paradox)
- Use simple, clear messaging
- Progressive disclosure for complex products
- Visual hierarchy to guide attention

**Research:** Sweller, J. (1988). "Cognitive load during problem solving"

**Example:** Apple's product lineup (3 tiers: Good, Better, Best) vs. Samsung's 20+ smartphone models

### 1.3 Heuristics in Consumer Decisions

**Availability Heuristic:**
- Consumers judge probability by ease of recall
- **Application:** Repetition in advertising, memorable branding
- **Example:** "9 out of 10 dentists recommend" (creates availability)

**Representative Heuristic:**
- Judging based on stereotypes/prototypes
- **Application:** Brand archetypes, visual stereotypes
- **Example:** Luxury brands use serif fonts (associated with tradition/quality)

**Anchoring Heuristic:**
- First number influences subsequent judgments
- **Application:** MSRP vs. sale price, tiered pricing
- **Example:** "$299 $99" (anchor at $299)

**Research:** Tversky & Kahneman (1974). "Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases"

### 1.4 Decision Fatigue

**Principle:** Quality of decisions deteriorates after long sessions.

**Applications:**
- Place high-margin items early in customer journey
- Simplify late-stage checkout
- Use defaults strategically
- Reduce decision points

**Research:** Baumeister et al. (1998). "Ego depletion: Is the active self a limited resource?"

**Example:** Amazon's "1-Click" ordering reduces late-stage friction

### 1.5 Paradox of Choice

**Principle:** Too many options decrease satisfaction and increase abandonment.

**Key Findings (Iyengar & Lepper, 2000):**
- 24 jam varieties: 3% purchase rate
- 6 jam varieties: 30% purchase rate
- **10x conversion** by reducing choice!

**Applications:**
- Curated selections
- Recommendation engines
- "Editor's picks" or "Best sellers"
- Progressive filtering

- **Products:** Social platforms, dating apps, community brands
- **Messaging:** "Join the family" "You belong here"

**Level 4: Esteem**
- Achievement, recognition, status
- **Products:** Luxury goods, certifications, awards
- **Messaging:** "Stand out" "Be recognized"

**Level 5: Self-Actualization**
- Purpose, creativity, potential
- **Products:** Education, artistic tools, coaching
- **Messaging:** "Become your best self" "Unlock potential"

**Marketing Strategy:**
- Identify which need your product fulfills
- Appeal to higher needs for premium positioning
- Use testimonials showing need fulfillment

### 2.2 Jobs-to-be-Done Theory (Christensen)

**Principle:** Consumers "hire" products to do specific jobs.

**Framework:**
1. **Functional job:** What task needs completion?
2. **Emotional job:** How does customer want to feel?
3. **Social job:** How does customer want to be perceived?

**Research:** Christensen et al. (2016). "Competing Against Luck"

**Example: Milkshake Study**
- **Job:** Keep commuters satisfied during boring commute
- **Competitors:** Bananas, bagels, boredom
- **Insight:** Made thicker for longer consumption

**Application Steps:**
1. Identify the job customers are trying to accomplish
2. Understand context and circumstances
3. Design product/message around job completion
4. Position against alternative solutions (not just direct competitors)

- More sustainable long-term
- **Application:** Gamification, skill-building, creative expression
- **Example:** Canva's design tutorials (learn for satisfaction)

**Extrinsic Motivation:**
- Driven by external rewards (money, status, prizes)
- Effective for short-term behavior change
- **Application:** Loyalty points, discounts, referral bonuses
- **Example:** Starbucks Rewards program

**Key Insight:** Excessive extrinsic rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation (overjustification effect)

### 2.5 Goal Gradient Effect

**Principle:** Motivation increases as people approach a goal.

**Applications:**
- Progress bars
- "You're 80% there!"
- Artificially advanced starting points
- Visual completion cues

**Research:** Hull (1932). "The goal-gradient hypothesis and maze learning"

## Part 8: Loss Aversion & Prospect Theory

### 8.1 Loss Aversion (Kahneman & Tversky)

**Principle:** Losses loom larger than equivalent gains (2x to 2.5x).

**Key Finding:** Losing $100 feels worse than gaining $100 feels good.

**Applications:**

**Free Trial Framing:**
- ❌ "Get 30 days free"
- ✅ "Start now, cancel anytime" (emphasizes avoiding loss of opportunity)

**Money-Back Guarantees:**
- Reduces perceived risk of loss
- **Example:** "Try risk-free for 90 days"

**Loss-Framed Messaging:**
- "Don't miss out" vs "Get this deal"

- **Use:** Urgent actions, limited offers

**Research:** Tversky & Kahneman (1981). "The framing of decisions and the psychology of choice"

**Example:**
- 95% fat-free (gain frame) vs 5% fat (loss frame)
- Same information, different perception

### 8.5 Regret Aversion

**Principle:** Avoid actions that might lead to regret.

**Omission Bias:**

- $100 wine for $90 = minimal transaction utility (same $10 saving)

**Application:**
- Show MSRP alongside sale price
- "You save $X" messaging
- Comparison pricing
- "Best deal" labels

### 9.5 The Flat-Rate Bias

- Added $429 model (slightly better)
- $275 model sales increased dramatically

**Pricing Structure:**
- Small: $3
- Medium: $5 (decoy - poor value)

**Applications:**
- "You won't believe what happened next..."
- "The secret ingredient is..."
- "One weird trick..."
- Reveal sequences in email campaigns

**Research:** Loewenstein (1994). "The psychology of curiosity"
