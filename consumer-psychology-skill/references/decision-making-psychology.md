## 1. Kahneman & Tversky's Dual-Process Theory

### Historical Context

**Origins:**
- Daniel Kahneman (Psychologist) + Amos Tversky (Cognitive scientist)
- 1970s-2000s collaborative research
- 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics (Kahneman)
- Revolutionary: Applied psychology to economics

### System 1 (Automatic System)

**Characteristics:**
- **Speed:** Milliseconds to seconds
- **Effort:** No conscious effort required
- **Capacity:** Parallel processing (multiple tasks)
- **Control:** Autonomous, always active
- **Evolution:** Ancient (survival-based)

**When Activated:**
- Familiar situations
- Pattern recognition
- Emotional stimuli
- Time pressure
- Low cognitive resources

**Strengths:**
- Fast threat detection
- Efficient for routine tasks
- Low energy consumption
- Pattern matching expertise

**Weaknesses:**
- Prone to systematic errors (biases)
- Influenced by irrelevant context
- Overconfident
- Difficult to modify

**Marketing Implications:**

**Triggers for System 1:**
```
Visual: Bold colors, faces, movement
Emotional: Fear, joy, surprise
Social: Crowds, authorities, celebrities
Familiar: Brands, patterns, known faces
Simple: Clear CTAs, obvious choices
```

**System 1-Optimized Marketing:**
- Visual-first design
- Emotional storytelling
- Social proof prominent
- Brand consistency (familiarity)
- Single clear action
- Fast-loading pages
- Instant gratification messaging

**Research Example:**
Kahneman's "Bat and Ball Problem"
- Ball costs $0.10
- Ball and bat together cost $1.10
- How much does bat cost?
- System 1 answer: $1.00 (WRONG - feels right)
- System 2 answer: $1.05 (CORRECT - requires calculation)
- 50%+ of Harvard students get this wrong!

**Lesson:** Even intelligent people rely on System 1 and make predictable errors.

---

### System 2 (Reflective System)

**Characteristics:**
- **Speed:** Seconds to hours
- **Effort:** Requires conscious attention
- **Capacity:** Serial processing (one task at a time)
- **Control:** Voluntary activation
- **Evolution:** Recent (abstract reasoning)

**When Activated:**
- Novel situations
- Complex calculations
- Logical reasoning
- Self-control needed
- High-stakes decisions

**Strengths:**
- Accurate logical reasoning
- Can override System 1
- Handles complexity
- Self-aware

**Weaknesses:**
- Mentally exhausting
- Slow
- Lazy (prefers to avoid effort)
- Limited capacity

**Marketing Implications:**

**When Customers Use System 2:**
- High-value purchases ($1,000+)
- Complex products (B2B software)
- Long-term commitments (mortgages)
- Unfamiliar categories (first-time buyers)
- High perceived risk (health, legal)

**System 2-Optimized Marketing:**
- Detailed specifications
- Comparison charts
- ROI calculators
- Expert content (whitepapers)
- Free trials/demos
- Customer support access
- Transparent pricing
- Third-party validation

**Research Example:**
Kahneman's "Cognitive Reflection Test"

Question: "If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?"

- System 1: 100 minutes (feels right)
- System 2: 5 minutes (correct - requires thinking)

---

### The Interplay: System 1 vs System 2

**System 1 is the Default:**
- Runs continuously
- System 2 only activated when needed
- System 2 is "lazy" - seeks to avoid effort

**System 1 Proposes, System 2 Endorses:**
- System 1 generates intuitions
- System 2 evaluates (if activated)
- Often, System 2 merely rationalizes System 1's intuition

**Marketing Strategy:**

**Two-Step Approach:**
1. **Capture with System 1:** Emotional hook, visual appeal, social proof
2. **Justify with System 2:** Logical reasons, data, comparisons

**Example: Apple iPhone Marketing**
- **System 1:** Beautiful design, aspirational lifestyle, social status
- **System 2:** Technical specs, camera quality, ecosystem integration

**The Rationalization Loop:**
```
1. System 1 decides: "I want this iPhone" (emotional)
2. System 2 activates: "Wait, is this logical?"
3. System 2 searches for justification: "Well, the camera IS better..."
4. System 2 endorses: "This is a rational decision"
5. Purchase made, customer believes decision was logical
```

## 2. Heuristics & Biases

### Availability Heuristic

**Definition:** Judge frequency/probability by ease of recall.

**Mechanism:**
- Vivid memories feel more common
- Recent events overweighted
- Emotional events overweighted

**Research:** Tversky & Kahneman (1973)

**Classic Experiment:**
"Are there more words starting with 'R' or with 'R' as third letter?"
- Most say "starting with R"
- Actually 2x more words have R as third letter
- Easier to recall words by first letter (availability)

**Marketing Applications:**

**1. Repetition Creates Availability:**
```
Single ad impression: Low availability
7 ad impressions: Moderate availability
20+ impressions: High availability (brand top-of-mind)
```

**2. Memorable Events:**
- Viral campaigns (high availability through sharing)
- Shocking/emotional content (easier recall)
- Jingles and catchphrases (memorable through repetition)

**3. Case Studies & Testimonials:**
- Vivid success stories create availability
- Customers think: "This could happen to me" (based on availability)

**4. Media Mentions:**
- "As seen in Forbes, TechCrunch, WSJ"
- Creates perception of prominence

**Example: Shark Attacks vs. Falling Coconuts**
- Shark attacks: ~5/year globally
- Coconut deaths: ~150/year
- Yet people fear sharks more (media coverage creates availability)

**Brand Application:**
Red Bull's extreme sports sponsorships create availability of "energy" and "excitement" associations.

---

### Representativeness Heuristic

**Definition:** Judge probability by similarity to stereotype/prototype.

**Mechanism:**
- Ignore base rates (statistical frequency)
- Rely on similarity to mental prototype
- Ignore sample size

**Classic Experiment (Kahneman & Tversky):**

"Linda is 31, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was concerned with discrimination and social justice.

Which is more probable?
A) Linda is a bank teller
B) Linda is a bank teller AND active in feminist movement"

Most choose B (conjunction fallacy!). B cannot be more probable than A alone.

**Why?** Linda's description is representative of feminist prototype.

**Marketing Applications:**

**1. Brand Archetypes:**
- Luxury brands: Serif fonts, gold, minimalism (representative of "premium")
- Eco brands: Green, natural textures, earthy tones (representative of "natural")
- Tech brands: Sans-serif, blue, sleek (representative of "innovation")

**2. Spokesperson Selection:**
- Fit product with representative spokesperson
- Athletic wear: Athletic endorsers
- Skincare: Clear-skinned models
- Financial: Conservative, trustworthy image

**3. Customer Avatars:**
- Show representative customer in marketing
- "Sarah, 35, busy mom" (representative of target market)

**4. Visual Stereotypes:**
- Doctors in white coats
- Lawyers in suits
- Chefs in toques
- Creates instant recognition through representativeness

---

### Anchoring Heuristic

**Definition:** First number influences all subsequent numerical judgments.

**Mechanism:**
- Initial value creates reference point
- Adjustments from anchor are insufficient
- Works even with random/irrelevant anchors

**Classic Experiment (Tversky & Kahneman):**

Spin wheel of fortune (rigged to land on 10 or 65), then estimate:
"What % of African nations are in the UN?"

- Wheel showed 10: Average estimate 25%
- Wheel showed 65: Average estimate 45%
- Clearly irrelevant anchor, yet powerful effect!

**Marketing Applications:**

**1. MSRP Anchoring:**
```
MSRP: $299
Sale: $99
Perceived value: Anchored at $299, feels like huge deal
```

**2. Tiered Pricing:**
```
Premium: $997/mo (anchor)
Professional: $497/mo (looks reasonable)
Basic: $97/mo
```
Without $997 anchor, $497 seems expensive.

**3. "Up To" Claims:**
```
"Save up to 70%!" (anchors at maximum savings)
Reality: Most items 20-30% off
Feels disappointing vs. no anchor
```

**4. Decoy Pricing:**
```
Small: $3
Medium: $5 (decoy - poor value anchors large as "deal")
Large: $5.50 (looks amazing compared to medium)
```

**5. Starting Price in Negotiations:**
- Seller anchors high: "Worth $10k, asking $8k"
- Buyer anchors low: "Comparable sold for $5k, offering $5.5k"
- Final price pulled toward initial anchor

**Research Finding:**
Even experts fall prey to anchoring:
- Real estate agents' valuations influenced by listing price
- Judges' sentencing influenced by prosecutor's recommendation
- Managers' salary offers influenced by candidate's current salary

**Strategy:** Always anchor first in negotiations, pricing, comparisons.

## 3. Prospect Theory in Detail

### Core Insight

Traditional economics: People maximize expected utility
**Prospect Theory:** People evaluate gains/losses from reference point, not absolute wealth.

**Nobel Prize 2002:** Daniel Kahneman "for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science"

### Reference Dependence

**Principle:** Outcomes evaluated relative to reference point, not final state.

**Example:**

**Scenario A:**
- You have $1,000
- Win $100
- Now have $1,100
- **Feeling:** Happy (+$100 from reference)

**Scenario B:**
- You have $2,000
- Lose $900
- Now have $1,100
- **Feeling:** Unhappy (-$900 from reference)

Same final wealth ($1,100), different emotional states!

**Marketing Application:**

**Frame as Gains:**
- "Earn $500 bonus" (positive reference)
- "Save $500" (positive reference)

**Frame as Losses (when appropriate):**
- "Stop losing $500/month" (negative reference, motivates action)
- "Don't miss out" (loss of opportunity)

---

### Loss Aversion

**Key Finding:** Losses hurt about 2x-2.5x more than equivalent gains feel good.

**Mathematical:**
- Losing $100: -2.5 utility units
- Gaining $100: +1.0 utility unit

**Implications:**

**1. Endowment Effect:**
- Ownership increases perceived value
- Selling price > buying price (for same item)

**Experiment (Kahneman, Knetsch, Thaler):**
- Give students coffee mugs
- Median selling price: $7.12
- Median buying price (students without mugs): $2.87
- **2.5x difference** just from ownership!

**Marketing Application:**
- Free trials create ownership
- "Your personalized dashboard" (language of ownership)
- Customization increases endowment

**2. Status Quo Bias:**
- Prefer current state (switching feels like loss)
- Default options heavily influence behavior

**3. Risk Aversion in Gains:**
- Prefer sure gain over risky gain

**Example:**
A) 100% chance of $50
B) 50% chance of $100

Expected value equal ($50), but most choose A.

**4. Risk Seeking in Losses:**
- Prefer risky loss over sure loss (gamble to avoid sure loss)

**Example:**
A) 100% chance of losing $50
B) 50% chance of losing $100

Expected value equal (-$50), but most choose B (gamble to avoid sure loss).

**Marketing Implication:**
- Money-back guarantees reduce loss risk
- Free trials (no commitment loss)
- "Try risk-free"

---

### Diminishing Sensitivity

**Principle:** Marginal impact decreases with distance from reference point.

**Mathematical:**
- $0 → $100 feels bigger than $1,000 → $1,100
- Losing $0 → $100 hurts more than $1,000 → $1,100

**Graphically:**
```
Value Function:

    Gains
      |    /
      |  /
      | /
------+------ Reference Point
     /|
   /  |
  /   |
Losses
```

Steeper in losses (loss aversion), but concave in both domains (diminishing sensitivity).

**Marketing Applications:**

**1. Break Large Gains into Small Wins:**
```
Bad: "Save $1,200/year"
Good: "Save $100/month" (12 separate gains feel bigger)
Better: "Save $3.28/day" (365 separate gains!)
```

**2. Combine Losses:**
```
Bad: Shipping $10 + Tax $15 + Handling $5 = $30 (3 losses)
Good: Total fees $30 (single loss feels less bad)
```

**3. Silver Lining Principle:**
- Large loss + small gain = Still terrible
- Separate bad news, don't try to offset

**4. Small Prices Feel Trivial:**
```
$497/month = Significant
$16.23/day = "Less than a coffee"
```

---

### Probability Weighting

**Principle:** People don't weight probabilities linearly.

**Patterns:**
- **Overweight small probabilities** (0.1% → 5%)
- **Underweight moderate probabilities** (30% → 20%)
- **Near-certainty treated as certain** (99% → 100%)

**Examples:**

**Lottery Tickets:**
- Actual odds of winning: 1 in 300 million (0.00000033%)
- Psychological probability: "Could be me!" (much higher)
- Result: Overweight tiny probability, buy tickets

**Insurance:**
- Tiny probability of house fire
- Overweighted in mind → willing to overpay for insurance

**Marketing Applications:**

**1. Sweepstakes & Contests:**
- "Win a Tesla!" (tiny probability overweighted)
- Drives engagement beyond rational expected value

**2. Gamification:**
- Random rewards (loot boxes)
- Mystery discounts
- Surprise bonuses

**3. Rare Outcomes:**
- "1 in 100 orders gets FREE upgrade"
- Customers overweight chance, increases appeal

**4. Near-Certainty:**
- "99.9% uptime" treated as certain
- "Money-back guarantee" (near-certain refund if unhappy)

## 4. Decision Fatigue Research

### Core Research (Baumeister et al., 1998)

**Experiment:**
- Participants resist eating cookies (ego depletion task)
- Then solve unsolvable puzzles
- Depleted group gave up 60% faster

**Conclusion:** Self-control is a limited resource.

### Decision Quality Over Time

**Judges Study (Danziger, Levav, Avnaim-Pesso, 2011):**

Analyzed 1,112 parole decisions by Israeli judges:
- **Morning:** 65% approval rate
- **Before lunch:** 10% approval rate
- **After lunch:** 65% approval rate (reset!)
- **Before dinner:** 10% approval rate

**Implication:** Quality of decisions deteriorates throughout the day.

### Marketing Applications

**1. Timing Matters:**
```
Best conversion times:
- Early morning (fresh cognitive resources)
- After lunch (reset from break)

Worst conversion times:
- Late afternoon (depleted)
- After making many decisions
```

**2. Reduce Decision Points:**
```
Poor checkout: 15 fields, 8 optional choices, 3 upsells
Good checkout: 5 fields, pre-selected best option, single upsell
Result: 2x conversion improvement
```

**3. Default Options:**
- Pre-select recommended option
- Depleted users accept defaults

**4. Simplify Late-Stage:**
- Complex info early (energy available)
- Simple actions late (energy depleted)

**5. One Decision at a Time:**
```
Poor: Choose plan + add-ons + billing + features simultaneously
Good: Step 1: Choose plan → Step 2: Add-ons → Step 3: Billing
```

**Example: Obama's Wardrobe**
"I only wear gray or blue suits. I'm trying to pare down decisions. I don't want to make decisions about what I'm eating or wearing because I have too many other decisions to make."

**Lesson:** Eliminate trivial decisions to preserve energy for important ones.

## 5. Choice Architecture (Thaler & Sunstein)

### Nudge Theory

**Definition:** Designing choice environments to influence behavior without restricting freedom.

**Book:** "Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness" (2008)

### Default Effect

**Power of Defaults:**

**Organ Donation (Johnson & Goldstein, 2003):**
- **Opt-in countries:** 15% consent
- **Opt-out countries:** 90%+ consent
- **Same freedom of choice, different default!**

**Marketing Applications:**

**1. Pre-Selected Options:**
```
☑ Subscribe to newsletter (default checked)
☐ Subscribe to newsletter (default unchecked)

Result: 3x higher subscription rate with opt-out vs opt-in
```

**2. Recommended Plans:**
```
Basic: [ ]
Pro: [✓] RECOMMENDED
Enterprise: [ ]

Result: 2x more Pro selections vs no recommendation
```

**3. Auto-Renewal:**
- Default: Auto-renew subscriptions
- Result: 70%+ retention vs 30% manual renewal

### Ordering Effects

**Primacy Effect in Menus:**
- First item gets 2x selections
- **Application:** Place high-margin items first

**Choice Sequence:**
- Simple choices first (build momentum)
- Complex choices when engaged
- Confirming choice last (commitment)

### Decoy Effect (Asymmetric Dominance)

**Research:** Huber, Payne, & Puto (1982)

**Example:**

**Without Decoy:**
- Print subscription: $59
- Web subscription: $125

Most choose print (cheaper).

**With Decoy:**
- Print subscription: $59
- **Print subscription: $125** (DECOY - dominated)
- Print + Web: $125

Now most choose Print + Web (same price as print-only decoy!).

**Result:** Decoy shifts preference to target option.

**Application:** 3-tier pricing with middle tier as decoy.

## 6. Neurological Basis of Decisions

### Brain Regions Involved

**Prefrontal Cortex (PFC):**
- Rational analysis (System 2)
- Impulse control
- Long-term planning

**Amygdala:**
- Emotional responses (System 1)
- Fear, pleasure
- Quick reactions

**Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc):**
- Reward anticipation
- Dopamine release
- "Wanting" system

**Insula:**
- Pain, disgust
- Loss aversion
- "Disliking" system

### Neural Conflict in Purchase Decisions

**Research:** Knutson et al. (2007) - "Neural Predictors of Purchases"

**fMRI Study:**
1. Show product → NAcc activation (reward anticipation)
2. Show price → Insula activation (pain of paying)
3. Purchase decision → PFC activation (rational evaluation)

**Finding:**
- High NAcc + Low Insula = Purchase
- High Insula + Low NAcc = No purchase
- **Can predict purchase with 60% accuracy from brain scans alone!**

**Marketing Implications:**

**Increase NAcc (Reward):**
- Beautiful visuals
- Benefit-focused language
- Aspirational imagery
- Dopamine triggers (surprise, anticipation)

**Decrease Insula (Pain):**
- Reduce price salience
- Bundle pricing (hide individual costs)
- Financing ("only $49/month")
- Delayed payment
