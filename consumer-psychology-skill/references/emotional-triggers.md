## 2. Emotional Contagion

**Principle:** Emotions spread from person to person automatically and unconsciously.

**Mechanism:**
1. **Mimicry:** Automatically mimic facial expressions, voice, posture
2. **Feedback:** Own mimicry generates same emotion
3. **Contagion:** Emotion spreads through group

**Facebook Study (Kramer et al., 2014):**

---

## 3. Peak-End Rule

### Research Foundation

**Kahneman et al. (1993):** "When More Pain is Preferred to Less"

**Principle:** Experiences judged by peak (best or worst moment) and end, not average or total.

**Classic Experiment (Colonoscopy Study):**
- **Group A:** Standard procedure (8 min discomfort, ends at peak pain)
- **Group B:** Extended procedure (8 min same + 1 min low discomfort)

**Result:**
- Group B rated experience as LESS painful (despite more total pain!)
- **Why?** Ended on lower pain (better end), lower peak

**Implication:** Duration doesn't matter as much as peak and end moments.

---

### Marketing Applications

**Example: Zappos**
- Shoe doesn't fit (negative)
- Free overnight shipping for exchange (positive peak)
- Follow-up call checking satisfaction (positive end)
- **Result:** Customer loves brand despite initial problem!

**4. Email Sequences:**

**Campaign Structure:**
- **Early emails:** Build value
- **Peak email:** Biggest benefit/offer
- **Final email:** Strong CTA + bonus
- **End on high note:** Scarcity/urgency + last chance

**Don't:**
- End on weak offer
- Trail off
- Decrease value over time

**Do:**

- End with bang, not whimper

---

## 4. Anticipated Regret & FOMO

### Research Foundation

**Zeelenberg (1999):** "Anticipated Regret, Expected Feedback and Behavioral Decision Making"

### Marketing Applications

**1. Limited Time Offers:**

**Scarcity + Time Pressure:**
```
"Sale ends tonight"
"Only 3 hours left"
"Last chance"
```

**Anticipated Regret Trigger:**
- "How will you feel tomorrow if you miss this?"
- "Don't regret not taking action"
- "Limited time" = can't come back later

**Research (Aggarwal & Vaidyanathan, 2003):**
- Time scarcity increases purchase intent by 200%
- Especially effective for hedonic (vs. utilitarian) products

**2. Limited Quantity:**

```
"Only 2 left in stock"
"Limited edition"
"While supplies last"
```

**Booking.com Example:**
- "Only 1 room left at this price"
- "12 people looking at this property"
- "Booked 3 times in last 24 hours"

**Result:**
- Creates urgency
- Triggers FOMO
- Anticipated regret of missing out
- Faster decision-making

**3. Exclusivity:**

**Access Scarcity:**
```
"Members only"
"Invite only"
"Early access"
"VIP exclusive"
```

**Example: Clubhouse (2020-2021)**
- Invite-only access
- Celebrities participating
- "Happening now" conversations
- Explosive growth through FOMO

**4. Social Proof + FOMO:**

**Combination:**
```
"Join 10,000 people who've already signed up"
"Fastest-growing [product] of 2024"
"Everyone's talking about [product]"
```

**Bandwagon + FOMO:**
- Others are doing it (social proof)
- You're not (FOMO)
- Anticipated regret (missing trend)
- Action motivated

---

### Ethical Considerations

**Genuine Scarcity:**
- **Ethical:** True limited inventory
- **Unethical:** False scarcity (unlimited product, fake countdown)

**Authentic Urgency:**
- **Ethical:** Real deadline (sale actually ends)
- **Unethical:** Fake countdown that resets

**Respectful Frequency:**
- **Ethical:** Occasional limited offers
- **Unethical:** Constant "urgency" (creates distrust)

**Value Alignment:**
- **Ethical:** FOMO for genuine opportunities
- **Unethical:** Exploiting insecurities
