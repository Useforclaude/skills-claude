### Marketing Application Framework

**Step 1: Identify Your Product's Need Level**

Most products can address multiple levels:

**Example: Car Purchase**
- Level 1: Transportation (physiological - getting to work)
- Level 2: Safety features (safety - protecting family)
- Level 3: Family vehicle (belonging - family adventures)
- Level 4: Luxury brand (esteem - status symbol)
- Level 5: Electric vehicle (self-actualization - environmental purpose)

**Step 2: Segment by Need Level**

Different customers buy for different needs:

**Budget Segment:** Focus on Levels 1-2 (function, safety)
**Mid-Market:** Focus on Levels 2-3 (safety, belonging)
**Premium:** Focus on Levels 4-5 (esteem, actualization)

**Step 3: Message to Dominant Need**

**Messaging Hierarchy:**
```
Economy Brand: "Reliable transportation you can afford" (Levels 1-2)
Mid-Range Brand: "Safe, comfortable family adventures" (Levels 2-3)
Luxury Brand: "Arrive in style, command respect" (Level 4)
Purpose Brand: "Drive the future, reduce your impact" (Level 5)
```

**Step 4: Ladder Up for Premium Positioning**

Move messaging up the hierarchy for premium pricing:

**Basic Positioning:** Function (Level 1)
**Premium Positioning:** Status or purpose (Levels 4-5)

**Example: Coffee**
- Folgers: "The best part of waking up" (Level 1: caffeine need)
- Starbucks: "Third place," community (Level 3: belonging)
- Blue Bottle: Artisanal craft, connoisseurship (Level 4: esteem)

## 2. Jobs-to-be-Done Theory (Christensen)

### Core Concept

**Clayton Christensen (Harvard):** "Competing Against Luck" (2016)

**Principle:** Customers don't buy products; they "hire" them to do specific jobs.

**Focus:** Understand the job, not the customer demographics.

### The Milkshake Story

**Research Question:** How to sell more milkshakes?

**Traditional Approach:**
- Survey customers: "How can we improve?"
- Demographic analysis: Who buys milkshakes?
- Result: No clear insights

**JTBD Approach:**
- Observe when and why people buy
- Interview: "What job did you hire the milkshake to do?"

**Findings:**

**Morning Commuters (40% of sales):**
- **Job:** Make boring commute more interesting
- **Alternatives:** Bagels (crumbs), bananas (gone in 2 minutes), coffee (not filling)
- **Why milkshake wins:** Takes 20 minutes to consume, filling, one-handed, interesting flavors

**Afternoon Parents:**
- **Job:** Say "yes" to child without feeling like bad parent
- **Why milkshake:** Thick (lasts long), feels like treat but has "nutrition"

**Key Insight:** Same product, different jobs!

**Solutions:**
- **Morning:** Make thicker (longer consumption), add fruit chunks (more interesting), pre-paid card (faster purchase)
- **Afternoon:** Make thinner (faster), smaller size (appropriate for kids)

**Result:** Different products for different jobs, not one-size-fits-all.

---

### JTBD Framework

**Job Dimensions:**

**1. Functional Job:**
- What task needs completion?
- Practical, observable
- **Example:** "I need to hang a picture" (drill isn't the goal, hole is)

**2. Emotional Job:**
- How does customer want to feel?
- Often unstated
- **Example:** "I want to feel like a good parent"

**3. Social Job:**
- How does customer want to be perceived?
- Status and identity
- **Example:** "I want others to see me as environmentally conscious"

**JTBD Statement Template:**

```
When [situation],
I want to [motivation],
So I can [expected outcome].

Example:
When I'm on a boring commute (situation),
I want engaging consumption (motivation),
So I can make time pass enjoyably (outcome).
```

---

### Competitive Landscape (JTBD View)

**Traditional View:**
- Competitors = similar products
- Milkshake competes with other milkshakes

**JTBD View:**
- Competitors = alternative solutions to same job
- Milkshake competes with bagels, bananas, boredom, coffee

**Implications:**
- Expand competitive analysis
- Look across categories
- Understand all alternatives customer considers

**Example: Gym Membership**

**Traditional Competitors:** Other gyms

**JTBD Competitors (Job: Get in shape):**
- Home workout apps (Peloton)
- Outdoor running (free)
- Diet programs (Weight Watchers)
- Cosmetic procedures (Botox)
- Doing nothing (boredom, Netflix)

**Insight:** Must beat all alternatives, not just other gyms!

---

### Application to Marketing

**Step 1: Identify the Job**

**Interview Questions:**
- "What were you doing when you decided you needed this?"
- "What did you try before this?"
- "What would you do if this didn't exist?"
- "How do you know when the job is done well?"

**Step 2: Map Job Dimensions**

| Dimension | Customer Need | Current Solution | Pain Points |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| Functional | Commute engagement | Radio, podcasts | Not tailored, ads |
| Emotional | Feel productive | Audiobooks | Guilt about "wasting time" |
| Social | Appear sophisticated | NPR podcasts | Fear of seeming pretentious |

**Step 3: Design Around Job**

**Features that support job:**
- Make consumption time appropriate
- Remove obstacles to "hiring"
- Beat alternative solutions on job performance

**Step 4: Message the Job**

**Bad:** "Our milkshake has 20g protein"
**Good:** "Make your commute fly by"

**Bad:** "Our app has 1000+ workouts"
**Good:** "Get fit without leaving home"

---

### Famous JTBD Examples

**1. Snickers: "You're not you when you're hungry"**
- **Job:** Quick energy when hungry (not candy category competition)
- **Competitors:** Lunch, energy bars, skipping the meal
- **Positioning:** Hunger solution, not candy

**2. Intercom: "Make internet business personal"**
- **Job:** Connect with customers at scale
- **Competitors:** Email, phone calls, doing nothing
- **Positioning:** Personal at scale (job outcome)

**3. Slack: "Where work happens"**
- **Job:** Reduce email overload, coordinate teams
- **Competitors:** Email, meetings, hallway conversations
- **Positioning:** Work communication hub

---

## 3. Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan)

### Core Principles

**Edward Deci & Richard Ryan (1985):** Psychologists at University of Rochester

**Central Thesis:** Three innate psychological needs drive human motivation.

**Research:** 40+ years, 1000+ studies validating theory

---

### The Three Needs

**1. Autonomy**

**Definition:** Feeling of choice, volition, and control over one's actions.

**Not:** Independence or self-reliance

- Transparent opt-outs
- "It's your choice" language

**Example: Spotify**
- Free tier (autonomous choice to upgrade)
- Custom playlists (personal control)
- "Made for you" (personalized but user-controlled)

**Language:**
- ✅ "Choose your plan"
- ✅ "Your personalized experience"
- ✅ "Control your settings"
- ❌ "You must subscribe"
- ❌ "Required fields"

---

---

**3. Relatedness**

- Shared identity
- Emotional connection

**Marketing Applications:**

## 4. Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation

### Definitions

**Intrinsic Motivation:**
- Driven by internal rewards
- Activity itself is rewarding
- Examples: Curiosity, mastery, creativity, fun

**Extrinsic Motivation:**
- Driven by external rewards
- Separate from activity
- Examples: Money, prizes, grades, social approval

---

### Cognitive Evaluation Theory (Subset of SDT)

**Key Finding:** External rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation.

**Classic Experiment (Lepper, Greene, Nisbett, 1973):**

Children who enjoyed drawing:
- **Group A:** Drew for fun (intrinsic)
- **Group B:** Promised reward for drawing (extrinsic)

**Result:**
- Group A: Continued drawing in free time
- Group B: Stopped drawing when rewards removed

**Conclusion:** External rewards undermined intrinsic enjoyment!

---

### The Overjustification Effect

**Definition:** Excessive external reward reduces intrinsic motivation.

**Why?**
- External reward changes perception
- From "I do this because I enjoy it"
- To "I do this for the reward"
- When reward removed, no reason to continue

**Marketing Implications:**

**Avoid Over-Rewarding:**
```
Bad: Pay users for every engagement
Result: Users only engage for money, leave when payments stop

Good: Build inherently enjoyable product
Result: Users engage because they enjoy it, sustainable
```

**Example: Wikipedia**
- No payment for contributions
- Intrinsically motivated editors (sharing knowledge)
- More sustainable than paying contributors

---

### When to Use Each Type

**Intrinsic Motivation Best For:**
- Long-term engagement
- Creative tasks
- Community building
- Brand love
- Sustainable behavior change

**Extrinsic Motivation Best For:**
- Short-term activation
- One-time actions
- Tedious but necessary tasks
- Initial engagement (then transition to intrinsic)

**Hybrid Approach:**

**Example: Duolingo**
- **Intrinsic:** Fun game mechanics, learning satisfaction, progress
- **Extrinsic:** Streaks, leaderboards, achievements

**Key:** Extrinsic rewards support intrinsic motivation, don't replace it.

---

### Marketing Applications

**Building Intrinsic Motivation:**

**1. Make it Fun:**
- Gamification (not just points, but enjoyable mechanics)
- Delightful UX
- Surprising moments

**2. Enable Mastery:**
- Skill progression
- Achievements that matter
- Real competence development

**3. Provide Autonomy:**
- Choices and control
- Personalization
- Self-directed paths

**4. Create Meaning:**
- Purpose-driven brand
- Social impact
- Personal transformation

**Example: Glossier**
- **Intrinsic:** Community of beauty enthusiasts, creative expression
- **Extrinsic:** Referral rewards (supporting, not replacing intrinsic)
- **Result:** Passionate brand advocates

---

## 5. Goal-Setting Psychology (Locke & Latham)

### Core Principles

**Edwin Locke & Gary Latham:** "Goal Setting Theory" (1990)

**Key Finding:** Specific, challenging goals lead to higher performance than vague or easy goals.

**5 Principles of Effective Goals:**

**1. Clarity**
- Specific > Vague
- "Lose 10 lbs" > "Get healthier"

**2. Challenge**
- Difficult > Easy (if achievable)
- Optimal: Just beyond current capability

**3. Commitment**
- Public > Private
- Written > Unwritten

**4. Feedback**
- Progress tracking crucial
- Adjustments based on performance

**5. Task Complexity**
- Break complex goals into steps
- Avoid overwhelming

---

### Application to Marketing

**1. Help Customers Set Goals:**

**Example: Fitness Apps**
- "What's your goal?" (onboarding question)
- Specific targets (lose 10 lbs in 3 months)
- Challenging but achievable

**2. Track Progress:**
- Visual progress bars
- Milestone celebrations
- Regular updates

**Example: Savings Apps (Digit)**
- "Save for Hawaii trip: $3,000"
- Daily progress: "$1,247 / $3,000"
- "You're 42% there!"

**3. Public Commitment:**
- Social sharing of goals
- Accountability partners
- Public pledges

**Example: Strava**
- Share workout goals
- Challenge friends
- Public achievement feed

---

## 6. Motivation Triggers in Marketing

### Trigger 1: Progress

**Endowed Progress Effect (Nunes & Drèze, 2006):**

Experiment: Car wash loyalty cards
- **Group A:** 8 stamps needed (start at 0)
- **Group B:** 10 stamps needed (start with 2 free)

**Result:** Group B completed 2x more (82% vs 19%)

**Why?** Head start creates motivation to finish.

**Application:**
- LinkedIn: "Your profile is 40% complete"
- Apps: "You've unlocked 3 of 10 achievements"
- "You're almost there!"

---

### Trigger 2: Streaks

**Commitment Consistency (Cialdini):** Want to maintain consistent self-image.

**Streak Psychology:**
- Daily engagement creates habit
- Loss aversion protects streak
- Visible progress motivates

**Application:**
- Duolingo: Language learning streaks
- Snapchat: Snap streaks
- Apple Watch: Activity rings

---

### Trigger 3: Social Comparison

**Social Comparison Theory (Festinger, 1954):**
- People evaluate selves by comparing to others
- Upward comparison: Aspirational
- Downward comparison: Confidence

**Application:**
- Leaderboards (competitive)
- "You're in top 10%"
- "Others like you also bought..."

---

### Trigger 4: Variable Rewards

**Operant Conditioning (Skinner):**
- Variable rewards more motivating than fixed
- Creates anticipation and excitement
- Dopamine spikes

**Application:**
- Mystery discounts
- Random bonuses
- Loot boxes (games)
- "Spin the wheel"

**Ethical Note:** Can create addictive patterns; use responsibly.
