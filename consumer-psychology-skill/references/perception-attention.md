## 1. Selective Attention Mechanisms

### The Cocktail Party Effect

**Colin Cherry (1953):** "Some Experiments on the Recognition of Speech"

**Phenomenon:** Ability to focus on single conversation in noisy environment, yet hear own name across the room.

**Mechanism:**
- **Selective filtering:** Brain filters irrelevant stimuli
- **Personal relevance:** Own name breaks through filter
- **Attentional capture:** Personally relevant info captures attention automatically

**Marketing Applications:**

**1. Personalization:**
```
Generic: "Check out our sale"
Personalized: "Sarah, your favorites are on sale"
Result: 6x higher engagement
```

**2. Relevance Targeting:**
- Behavioral targeting
- Interest-based content
- Life-stage messaging
- Geographic personalization

**3. Name Usage:**
- Email subject lines with name
- "Your personal dashboard"
- Customized product recommendations

**Research Finding (Moray, 1959):**
- Participants shadow one ear (repeat what they hear)
- Different message to other ear
- Don't notice message in unattended ear
- **BUT:** 33% notice when own name spoken!

**Key Insight:** Personal relevance bypasses selective filtering.

### Inattentional Blindness

**Simons & Chabris (1999):** "Gorillas in Our Midst"

**Famous Experiment:**
- Watch video of people passing basketball
- Count passes by team wearing white
- **50% of viewers miss gorilla walking through scene!**

**Why?** Attention focused on counting, no capacity for unexpected stimuli.

**Marketing Implications:**

**Don't Introduce Distractions During Critical Moments:**

```
Bad: Pop-up during checkout (attention on completing purchase)
Good: Pop-up on browse pages (attention not focused)

Bad: New feature tour during first-time use (overwhelmed)
Good: Progressive feature disclosure after core action mastered
```

**Sequential Attention Design:**

**Step 1:** Single focus (complete signup)
**Step 2:** Secondary action (upload photo)
**Step 3:** Tertiary action (invite friends)

**Not:** All simultaneously!

**Example: Duolingo**
- Lesson focus: Only language exercise (no ads, no distractions)
- Between lessons: Ads and upsells (attention available)

---

### Change Blindness

**Rensink, O'Regan, Clark (1997):** "To See or Not to See"

**Phenomenon:** Fail to notice significant changes in visual scene.

**Experiment:**
- Show two similar images alternating with brief blank
- Large changes (color of building) often unnoticed
- Must attend to location of change to notice

**Marketing Implications:**

**1. Continuity in Branding:**
- Consistent visual identity
- Gradual changes (not abrupt)
- Familiar patterns maintained

**2. A/B Testing Insight:**
- Small changes may go unnoticed (good for testing)
- Major redesigns require announcement

**3. Banner Blindness:**
- Users develop blindness to ad patterns
- Solution: Non-standard ad placements, native advertising

**Research (Benway & Lane, 1998):**
- 47% miss information in banner-like location
- Even when searching for that exact information!

**Solution:** Break expected patterns (but maintain brand consistency).

---

### Attentional Blink

**Raymond, Shapiro, Arnell (1992):**

**Phenomenon:** Miss second target if it appears 200-500ms after first.

**Why?** Attentional resources briefly exhausted after processing first target.

**Marketing Implications:**

**Spacing of Information:**
```
Bad: "Free shipping! + 30% off + Buy 1 Get 1 + New arrivals!"
Result: Later messages missed (attentional blink)

Good: "Free shipping on all orders" (process this first)
Later: "Plus 30% off select items" (after attentional recovery)
```

**Email Design:**
- Single primary message per email
- Secondary messages separated by whitespace
- Time between CTAs

---

## 2. Priming Effects

### Definition

**Priming:** Exposure to stimulus influences response to subsequent stimulus (without awareness).

**Types:**
1. **Semantic priming:** Related concepts
2. **Perceptual priming:** Similar forms
3. **Conceptual priming:** Abstract associations
4. **Behavioral priming:** Actions

---

### Semantic Priming

**Meyer & Schvaneveldt (1971):** Lexical decision task

**Experiment:**
- Faster to recognize "NURSE" after seeing "DOCTOR"
- Faster to recognize "BREAD" after seeing "BUTTER"
- Related concepts activate each other

**Marketing Applications:**

**1. Word Associations:**
```
Product: Premium headphones
Prime with: "Studio," "Professional," "Audiophile"
Result: Activates quality associations
```

**2. Sequential Messaging:**
```
Email 1: "Luxury you deserve"
Email 2 (next day): Product offer
Result: "Luxury" association already primed
```

**3. Category Priming:**
```
Before product page: Customer testimonial about "life-changing quality"
Product page: "Change your life" CTA
Result: Association already activated
```

---

### Perceptual Priming

**Tulving et al. (1982):** Priming improves recognition even without conscious memory.

**Examples:**

**Shape Priming:**
- Round shapes → softness, friendliness
- Angular shapes → strength, durability

**Color Priming:**
- Red → excitement, urgency
- Blue → trust, calm

**Application:**

**Landing Page Design:**
1. Hero image with desired emotion (excitement)
2. Color scheme reinforcing emotion (warm colors)
3. Shapes consistent with message (dynamic angles)
4. Copy activating primed concepts ("exciting opportunity")

**Result:** Coherent priming across elements amplifies effect.

### Behavioral Priming

**Bargh, Chen, Burrows (1996):** "Automaticity of Social Behavior"

**Famous Experiment:**
- Participants unscramble sentences
- **Group A:** Sentences contain "elderly" related words (old, bingo, Florida)
- **Group B:** Neutral words

**Result:** Group A walked slower leaving lab (primed with "elderly" behavior)!

**Marketing Applications:**

**1. Action Priming:**
```
Before signup form:
- Image of person typing/clicking
- "Join thousands who have already started"
Result: Action primed, higher conversion
```

**2. Speed Priming:**
```
Fast food restaurant:
- Red/yellow colors (energy)
- Upbeat music (tempo)
- Hard seats (don't linger)
Result: Fast dining, high turnover
```

**3. Luxury Priming:**
```
Luxury retail:
- Soft music (calm)
- Spacious layout (exclusivity)
- Gentle lighting (relaxation)
Result: Leisurely browsing, higher spend
```

**Research (North, Hargreaves, McKendrick, 1999):**
- French music in wine store → more French wine sales
- German music → more German wine sales
- **Customers unaware of influence!**

---

### Money Priming

**Vohs, Mead, Goode (2006):** "The Psychological Consequences of Money"

**Experiment:**
- Prime with money images/Monopoly money
- **Results:**
  - Less helpful to others
  - Prefer working alone
  - More self-sufficient behavior
  - Greater distance from others

**Marketing Implications:**

**Avoid Money Primes When Building Community:**
```
Bad: Dollar signs in community-building contexts
Good: People imagery, connection symbols
```

**Use Money Primes for Individual Achievement:**
```
Investment apps: Currency symbols, growth charts
Result: Self-focused financial behavior
```

---

### Social Priming

**Research:** Images of groups prime conformity, images of individuals prime independence.

**Application:**

**For Social Proof:**
- Show crowds of customers
- Group testimonials
- Community imagery

**For Individual Choice:**
- Solo user imagery
- "Your personal" language
- Individual customization

## 4. Gestalt Principles

### Background

**Gestalt Psychology (1920s):** "The whole is greater than the sum of parts"

**Core Idea:** Brain organizes visual information into coherent wholes.

---

### Proximity

**Principle:** Objects close together perceived as related.

**Application:**

**Form Design:**
```
Bad:
Name:     [_____]
Email:    [_____]
Address:  [_____]
City:     [_____]

Good:
Personal Info
Name:     [_____]
Email:    [_____]

Address
Street:   [_____]
City:     [_____]
```

**Product Layout:**
- Group related products
- Spacing between categories
- Whitespace for separation

---

### Similarity

**Principle:** Similar objects perceived as grouped.

**Application:**

**Navigation Design:**
- Similar style for category links
- Different style for CTAs
- Consistent button styling

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Headlines: Same font/size
- Body text: Consistent styling
- CTAs: Distinct appearance

---

### Continuity

**Principle:** Eyes follow lines and curves naturally.

**Application:**

**Directional Cues:**
- Arrows pointing to CTA
- Gaze direction in photos
- Curved lines guiding eye
- F-pattern layout (web reading)

**Example:**
- Image of person looking at product → eyes follow gaze
- Arrow from benefit to CTA → guides action

---

### Closure

**Principle:** Brain completes incomplete shapes.

**Application:**

**Logo Design:**
- FedEx: Arrow in negative space (not explicit)
- NBC: Peacock from colored shapes
- WWF: Panda from negative space

**Incomplete Patterns:**
- Creates engagement (brain works to complete)
- Memorable (active processing)

---

### Figure-Ground

**Principle:** Distinguish focal object (figure) from background (ground).

**Application:**

**Contrast:**
- High contrast for important elements
- Low contrast for supporting elements

**Negative Space:**
- Whitespace creates focus
- Reduces cognitive load
- Premium feel

**Example: Apple**
- Product (figure) on white background (ground)
- Clear focal point
- Minimal distractions

---

### Common Fate

**Principle:** Elements moving together perceived as related.

**Application:**

**Animation:**
- Group elements with synchronized animation
- Parallax scrolling (related items move together)
- Hover effects on related items

---

## 5. Visual Hierarchy

### Principles

**1. Size:**
- Larger = more important
- Headlines > subheads > body

**2. Color:**
- High contrast = importance
- Bright colors attract attention

**3. Position:**
- Top/left = primary (F-pattern)
- Center = focal
- Bottom = secondary

**4. Typography:**
- Bold = emphasis
- Italic = secondary emphasis
- Uppercase = URGENCY

**5. Spacing:**
- Whitespace = importance
- Cramped = less important

---

### F-Pattern Reading (Nielsen Norman Group)

**Eye-Tracking Research:**

**Pattern:**
1. Horizontal movement across top (top bar of F)
2. Move down left side
3. Short horizontal movement (middle bar of F)
4. Continue down left side

**Heatmap:** F-shaped pattern

**Application:**

**Content Placement:**
- Logo: Top-left
- Primary navigation: Top horizontal
- Important content: Top and left
- CTAs: Along F-pattern

**Example: News Sites**
- Headlines along left (scan column)
- Top stories across top (horizontal scan)

---

### Z-Pattern (Less Text)

**For Visual-Heavy Layouts:**

**Pattern:**
1. Top-left → Top-right (horizontal)
2. Top-right → Bottom-left (diagonal)
3. Bottom-left → Bottom-right (horizontal)

**Application:**
- Landing pages
- Print ads
- Banners

**Layout:**
- Logo: Top-left
- Value prop: Top-center
- Social proof: Middle
- CTA: Bottom-right

---

**Scent-Product Matching:**
- Cleaning products: Lemon scent (cleanliness association)
- Luxury hotels: Signature scents (memory anchoring)

---

### Touch/Haptics

**Research (Peck & Childers, 2003):**
- Touching product increases perceived ownership
- Longer touch duration = higher valuation
- "Need for touch" varies by individual

**Applications:**

**Product Design:**
- Smooth/premium materials (luxury)
- Textured packaging (engagement)
- Weight (heavier = higher quality perception)

**Retail:**
- Testers and samples
- Try-before-buy
- Tactile displays

**Digital:**
- Haptic feedback (smartphone vibrations)
- Scroll resistance (premium apps)

---

### Cross-Modal Correspondences

**Research (Spence, 2011):**
- Angular shapes → sharp tastes (sour, bitter)
- Rounded shapes → sweet tastes
- Heavy → dark colors
- Light → bright colors

**Application:**

**Packaging Design:**
- Round package for sweet product
- Angular for intense/sour
- Heavy materials for premium

**Example: Coca-Cola**
- Rounded bottle (sweet association)
- Red color (excitement, energy)
- Distinctive shape (tactile memory)
