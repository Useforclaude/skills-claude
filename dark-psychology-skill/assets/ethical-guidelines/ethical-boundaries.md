## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. The Golden Rule (Updated)

**Traditional:** "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"

**Updated for Psychology:** "Treat others as they want to be treated, respecting their autonomy and dignity"

**What this means:**
- Your wants don't override their consent
- Respect their boundaries, not just yours
- Empower, don't control
- Win-win, not win-lose

---

### 2. The Consent Principle

**Everything requires informed consent:**
- Informed: They have full information
- Voluntary: Free choice, no coercion
- Competent: Able to consent
- Ongoing: Can be withdrawn anytime

**What this means:**
- No manipulation to get "yes"
- No wearing down resistance
- No taking advantage of vulnerability
- No assuming consent
- No punishing "no"

---

### 3. The Autonomy Principle

**Everyone has right to:**
- Make their own decisions
- Set their own boundaries
- Choose their own path
- Say no without punishment
- Leave any relationship

**What this means:**
- You can influence, not control
- Their life is theirs to live
- Disagreement doesn't mean you can override
- Respect their choices even if you disagree

---

### 4. The Honesty Principle

**Truth is baseline:**
- Don't lie
- Don't omit important information
- Don't mislead
- Don't hide your true intentions
- Correct misunderstandings

**When honesty conflicts with kindness:**
- Choose kind honesty
- "I don't want to share that"
- Not brutal honesty (cruelty masked)
- Not dishonesty (avoiding discomfort)

---

### 5. The Harm Principle

**Never intentionally cause:**
- Psychological harm
- Emotional harm
- Physical harm
- Financial harm
- Reputational harm
- Spiritual harm

**Even if:**
- They "deserve" it
- They hurt you first
- You're angry
- You'd benefit
- You could get away with it

## Context Matters, But Not as Excuse

### "But What If...?"

**Common justifications:**

**"What if they deserve it?"**
- No one deserves abuse
- If they wronged you, address it directly or leave
- Revenge ≠ justice
- You're not entitled to punish
- Two wrongs don't make right

**"What if I'm angry?"**
- Anger is valid
- Abuse is not
- Take space to cool down
- Express anger without manipulation
- Get therapy if anger is controlling you

**"What if they did it to me first?"**
- You don't have to stoop to their level
- Responding with manipulation makes you a manipulator too
- Leave if they're abusive
- Don't become what you hate
- Break the cycle

**"What if it's just a joke?"**
- Intent doesn't erase impact
- If they're hurt, apologize
- Don't dismiss their feelings
- "Just joking" is often abuser's defense
- Be kind, not "funny" at their expense

**"What if I need to protect myself?"**
- Protection ≠ manipulation
- Gray rock, boundaries, leaving = protection
- Gaslighting, isolating them = manipulation
- You can exit without abusing
- Defense is about you, not controlling them

**"What if everyone does it?"**
- Everyone doesn't
- Even if they did, it's still wrong
- Be better than average
- Integrity matters
- You choose who you want to be

## Gray Areas (Proceed with Caution)

### When Influence Becomes Manipulation

**Influence (ethical):**
- Sharing your perspective
- Providing information
- Expressing your feelings
- Making requests
- Accepting "no"

**Manipulation (unethical):**
- Controlling their perspective
- Hiding information
- Using emotions as weapons
- Demanding compliance
- Punishing "no"

**The line:**
- Do they feel free to disagree?
- Are you honest about your motives?
- Can they say no without consequence?
- Are you respecting their autonomy?
- Would you be okay if this were public?

---

### Persuasion vs Coercion

**Persuasion (ethical):**
- Logical arguments
- Emotional honesty (not manipulation)
- Presenting facts
- Respecting their process
- Accepting their decision

**Coercion (unethical):**
- Threats
- Pressure
- Wearing them down
- Exploiting vulnerabilities
- No won't be accepted

**The line:**
- Are they free to refuse?
- Are you using fear/guilt/shame?
- Are you giving time to think?
- Are you respecting their "no"?
- Is this win-win or win-lose?

---

## Self-Check Questions

Before using psychological knowledge, ask:

### Intention Check
- [ ] What is my true intention?
- [ ] Am I being honest with myself?
- [ ] Would I want this done to me?
- [ ] Am I seeking win-win or win-lose?

### Method Check
- [ ] Am I being honest with them?
- [ ] Am I respecting their autonomy?
- [ ] Can they freely say no?
- [ ] Am I exploiting vulnerability?
- [ ] Would I defend this publicly?

### Outcome Check
- [ ] Could this cause harm?
- [ ] Am I getting consent?
- [ ] Is this empowering or controlling them?
- [ ] Would I be proud of this?
- [ ] Does this align with my values?

**If you answered "no" to any question, reconsider your approach.**
