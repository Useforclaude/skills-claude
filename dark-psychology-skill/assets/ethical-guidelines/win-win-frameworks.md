### Conflict Resolution (Win-Win)

**Traditional (Win-Lose):**
1. State your position
2. Defend your position
3. Attack their position
4. Someone wins, someone loses
5. Resentment builds

**Win-Win Approach:**

**Step 3: Brainstorm Together**
- Generate options together
- No criticism during brainstorming

**Step 4: Find Third Alternative**
- Not your way or my way
- Better option neither thought of alone
- Synergy: 1+1=3
- Both needs met better than original proposals

**Step 5: Commit Together**
- Both invested in solution
- Both feel heard
- Both got needs met
- Relationship stronger
- Sustainable solution

### Example: Weekend Plans Conflict

**Scenario:**

## Win-Win in Conflict

### The Conflict Framework

**Step 1: Separate People from Problem**
- Attack the problem, not each other
- "We're on same team against the problem"
- Not: "You're the problem"
- But: "How do we solve this together?"

**Step 2: Focus on Interests, Not Positions**

**Position:** What you say you want
**Interest:** Why you want it

**Example:**
- Position: "I want the car Saturday"
- Interest: "I need to get to work"

**Solution space:**
- Car isn't only way to get to work
- Carpool, bus, bike, friend, etc.
- More options when you focus on interest

**Step 3: Generate Options**
- Brainstorm without judgment
- Quantity over quality initially
- Build on each other's ideas
- "Yes, and..." not "No, but..."

**Step 4: Use Objective Criteria**
- What's fair?
- What do experts say?
- What's market value?
- What's legal/ethical?
- Remove personal bias

**Step 5: Develop Win-Win Agreement**
- Both needs met
- Both committed
- Specific and measurable
- Timeline clear
- Follow-up planned

### Example: Household Chores Conflict

**Scenario:**
- Both work full-time
- House is mess
- Resentment building

**Win-Lose Approaches:**
- One person does everything (lose-win)
- Fight about it constantly (lose-lose)
- Demand the other do more (win-lose attempt)

**Win-Win Process:**

**Step 1: Separate People from Problem**
- "We're both overwhelmed by housework"
- Not: "You never help"
- Problem: Too many chores, too little time
- Team: Us together

**Step 2: Understand Interests**
- Both want: Clean home, less stress, fair division
- You: Hate dishes, don't mind laundry
- Them: Hate laundry, don't mind dishes

**Step 3: Generate Options**
- Split by preference (you: laundry, them: dishes)
- Hire cleaning service for deep clean
- Declutter (less stuff = less mess)
- Daily 15-minute team clean
- Trade chores weekly
- Each person has own areas

**Step 4: Objective Criteria**
- Fair: Equal time, not equal tasks
- Preference: Do what you hate least
- Efficiency: Do what you're faster at
- Budget: Can we afford help?

**Step 5: Agreement**
- You: Laundry, vacuuming, bathrooms
- Them: Dishes, dusting, trash
- Both: 15-min daily team clean
- Both: Hire deep clean monthly
- Review: In 1 month, adjust if needed

**Outcome:**
- Both: Chores you don't mind as much
- Both: Less total time (efficiency)
- Both: Cleaner home
- Both: Less resentment
- Relationship: Stronger through collaboration
