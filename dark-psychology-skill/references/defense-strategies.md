## Prevention Strategies

### Know Yourself

**Identify your vulnerabilities:**
- What are your emotional triggers?
- What do you desperately want? (manipulators target this)
- What are you afraid of losing?
- Where are your boundaries weak?
- What's your attachment style?

**Self-awareness exercises:**
- Journal about past relationships
- Notice patterns in who you're attracted to
- Identify when you ignore red flags
- Understand your childhood wounds
- Therapy to explore blind spots

---

### Red Flag Recognition

**Universal red flags (trust these):**
- You feel uncomfortable but can't explain why
- They don't respect "no"
- They rush you to decide
- They isolate you from others
- Story changes frequently
- They play victim constantly
- They never apologize genuinely
- You walk on eggshells
- You've changed significantly (not for better)
- You're defending them to others

**Early warning signs:**
- Love bombing (too intense too fast)
- Moving relationship fast
- Wants exclusivity immediately
- Shares trauma early (pity play)
- All exes are "crazy"
- No long-term relationships
- Different in public vs private
- Doesn't have close friends
- Family doesn't talk to them

**Trust your gut:**
- First impressions are often right
- Your body knows before your mind
- Discomfort is a signal
- Don't rationalize away unease
- "Benefit of doubt" isn't required

---

### Healthy Relationship Baseline

**What healthy looks like:**
- Respects your "no"
- Consistent behavior
- Actions match words
- Takes responsibility
- Communicates clearly
- Encourages your independence
- Supports your goals
- No walking on eggshells
- Can disagree respectfully
- You feel safe

**Compare new relationships to this baseline:**
- Does this relationship meet these standards?
- What's missing?
- Are you making excuses?
- Would you want this for a friend?

---

### Take It Slow

**Why rushing is red flag:**
- Manipulators need fast commitment
- Before you see real them
- Before you can verify their story
- Creates artificial intensity
- Trauma bond forms quickly

**How to slow down:**
- Set pace you're comfortable with
- Don't be pressured
- Take time to know them
- Meet their friends/family
- See them in different contexts
- Watch behavior over time (months, not weeks)

**If they pressure you:**
- "I like to take relationships slow"
- "I'm not comfortable with that pace"
- Notice if they respect your pace
- Major red flag if they don't

---

### Maintain Independence

**Keep your own:**
- Friends (don't drop them for relationship)
- Hobbies (maintain interests)
- Space (own place if possible)
- Finances (separate account)
- Goals (don't abandon dreams)
- Identity (you're more than the relationship)

**Why this matters:**
- Harder to manipulate independent people
- You have exit options
- Maintain perspective
- Support system intact
- Identity preserved

**Red flags:**
- They want all your time
- Jealous of your friends
- Criticizes your interests
- Financial enmeshment too fast
- Wants you to give up goals

---

## Early Detection Methods

### Pattern Recognition

**Look for patterns, not isolated incidents:**
- Once = mistake
- Twice = pattern emerging
- Three+ times = who they are

**Common patterns:**
- Promise → break → excuse → repeat
- Nice → mean → nice → mean (cycle)
- Blame others for everything
- Apologize → no change → repeat
- Create drama → play victim → repeat

**Pattern documentation:**
```
Date: [date]
Pattern: [what keeps happening]
Frequency: [how often]
Your response: [what you typically do]
Their response: [how they react]
```

---

### Behavior vs Words

**Watch what they do, not what they say:**
- Actions reveal character
- Words can be lies
- Inconsistency is information
- Believe the behavior

**Common inconsistencies:**
- Says: "I love you" / Does: Treats you badly
- Says: "I'll change" / Does: Same behavior
- Says: "You're important" / Does: Ignores you
- Says: "I'm honest" / Does: Lies frequently
- Says: "I respect you" / Does: Violates boundaries

**When words and actions conflict:**
- Believe the actions
- Point out the discrepancy
- Notice their response
- Don't accept gaslighting
- Exit if pattern continues

---

### Context Checking

**Verify their story:**
- Talk to people they mention
- Check facts they state
- Search their name online
- Verify credentials
- Ask detailed questions about their past

**Background check (for serious relationships):**
- Public records search
- Criminal background check
- Previous addresses
- Bankruptcy/liens
- Social media history

**If they object to verification:**
- "I verify everyone" (not personal)
- Notice if they're defensive
- Healthy people understand
- Manipulators will resist
- Major red flag if they flip out

---

### Reality Testing

**Check your perception:**
- Talk to trusted friends about relationship
- "Does this seem normal to you?"
- Ask if they've noticed changes in you
- Get objective perspective
- Don't isolate

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- Am I making excuses for them?
- Would I accept this behavior from a friend?
- Am I who I want to be in this relationship?
- Do I feel better or worse since meeting them?
- Am I becoming isolated?
- Do I trust my own judgment?

**If you're constantly doubting yourself:**
- This is a red flag
- Possible gaslighting
- Document what happens
- Get external validation
- Consider exiting

---
