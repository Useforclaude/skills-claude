## Key Features

### Complete Neuroscience Coverage

**Dopamine Pathways:**
- Mesolimbic (reward pathway)
- Mesocortical (executive function)
- Nigrostriatal (motor/habit)
- Tuberoinfundibular (hormonal)

**Receptors & Genetics:**
- D1-D5 receptors
- DRD2, DRD4 genetic variants
- Individual differences

**Release Patterns:**
- Tonic vs phasic dopamine
- Prediction error coding
- Tolerance and sensitization

### Behavioral Psychology Models

**Hook Model (Nir Eyal):**
1. Trigger (external/internal)
2. Action (simplest behavior)
3. Variable Reward (tribe/hunt/self)
4. Investment (stored value)

**Tiny Habits (BJ Fogg):**
- B = MAT formula
- Anchor to existing habits
- Celebrate immediately

**Habit Loop (Charles Duhigg):**
- Cue ‚Üí Routine ‚Üí Reward
- 66-day formation timeline

### Variable Reward Schedules

**Skinner's 4 Schedules:**
- Fixed Ratio (predictable)
- Variable Ratio (slot machines) ‚Üê Most addictive
- Fixed Interval (time-based)
- Variable Interval (checking email)

**Modern Applications:**
- Social media feeds
- Loot boxes
- Dating apps
- Push notifications

### Real-World Case Studies

**Analyzed Apps:**
1. **Duolingo** (95/100) - Ethical excellence
2. **TikTok** (35/100) - Highly addictive
3. **Instagram** (45/100) - Mixed ethics
4. **Candy Crush** (15/100) - Dark patterns
5. **Headspace** (85/100) - Ethical design

## Tools Included

### Engagement Scorer Script

Python tool to analyze features for addiction risk:

```bash
# Interactive mode
python engagement_scorer.py --interactive

# Analyze JSON file
python engagement_scorer.py --analyze feature.json

# See examples
python engagement_scorer.py --examples
```

**Features:**
- Scores 30+ dopamine techniques
- Risk level classification (Low/Moderate/High/Severe)
- Specific warnings for each feature
- Recommendations to reduce addiction risk
- Export results to JSON

**Example Output:**
```
Feature: Social Media Feed
Total Score: 54
Risk Level: SEVERE RISK - Do Not Build

Warnings:
üö® GAMBLING MECHANICS DETECTED
‚ö†Ô∏è  INFINITE ENGAGEMENT PATTERN
‚ö†Ô∏è  NO SAFEGUARDS DETECTED

Recommendations:
‚úÖ ADD: Usage time limits
‚úÖ REPLACE: Infinite scroll with 'Load more'
‚úÖ ADD: Natural stopping points
```

## Ethical Framework

### Mandatory Checks Before Implementation

**1. Value Alignment Test:**
- Does this help users achieve THEIR goals?
- Or just our business metrics?

**2. Addiction Risk Assessment:**
- Could this create compulsive behavior?
- Are there stopping cues?
- Can users easily quit?

**3. Vulnerable Population Protection:**
- Could this harm children?
- Exploit addiction-prone individuals?
- Take advantage of mental health issues?

**4. Transparency Test:**
- Can we publicly explain our methods?
- Would users approve if they understood?

**5. Personal Test:**
- Would I want my child using this?
- Would I use this myself?

**If any test fails ‚Üí DO NOT BUILD**

## Usage Examples

### Ethical Example: Duolingo

**Techniques Used:**
- Streaks (with freeze option)
- XP and levels
- Achievements
- Leaderboards (optional)

**Why Ethical:**
- Educational value at core
- Free tier fully functional
- User goals = app goals (learn language)
- Can pause streak without penalty
- No pay-to-win

**Result:** 500M+ users, proven learning outcomes

---

### Unethical Example: Gacha Game

**Techniques Used:**
- Loot boxes (gambling)
- Variable ratio rewards
- Collection completion drive
- Limited-time events (FOMO)
- Sunk cost mechanics
- Progress loss threat

**Why Unethical:**
- Gambling disguised as game
- Targets addiction-prone
- No real-world value
- Designed to extract maximum money
- Often targets children

**Result:** 0.15% "whales" spend $1000+/month, bankruptcies reported

---

## When to Use This Skill

**Perfect for:**
- Understanding addiction mechanics
- Designing ethical engagement
- Health behavior change apps
- Educational platforms
- Therapeutic interventions
- Protecting vulnerable users

## Quick Reference

### Dopamine Release by Activity

| Activity | Dopamine Increase | Duration |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| Food | +50% | 5-10 min |
| Sex | +100% | 5-15 min |
| Social Media Like | +13% | 1-2 min |
| Variable Reward | +75% | 2-5 min |
| Cocaine | +350% | 60-120 min |

### Most Addictive Techniques

1. **Variable Ratio Rewards** (Score: 9/10)
2. **Infinite Scroll** (Score: 9/10)
3. **Loot Boxes** (Score: 10/10)
4. **FOMO Mechanics** (Score: 8/10)
5. **Progress Loss Threat** (Score: 9/10)

### Addiction Warning Signs (DSM-5)

- Tolerance (need more for same effect)
- Withdrawal (anxiety when unable to access)
- Loss of control (use more than intended)
- Continued despite harm
- Preoccupation (constant thoughts)
- Neglecting activities
- Deception (hiding usage)

**4+ symptoms = addiction likely**

## Metrics That Matter

### Traditional (Misleading)
- ‚ùå Daily Active Users
- ‚ùå Time on site
- ‚ùå Engagement rate
- ‚ùå Retention rate

### Humane (Better)
- ‚úÖ Time well spent (user-rated)
- ‚úÖ Goal completion rate
- ‚úÖ User satisfaction
- ‚úÖ Regretful usage %
- ‚úÖ "Made my life better" ratings

**Formula:** Success = Engagement √ó Satisfaction √ó Retention / Regret

---

## Ethical Design Patterns

### Instead of Infinite Scroll:
```
‚úÖ Finite feed + "Load more" button
‚úÖ "You're all caught up!" message
‚úÖ Time-based pausing
```

### Instead of Push Notifications:
```
‚úÖ Importance filtering
‚úÖ Batched summaries
‚úÖ Max 3 per day limit
‚úÖ Granular controls
```

### Instead of Streaks:
```
‚úÖ Streak freeze/vacation mode
‚úÖ Weekly goals (not daily pressure)
‚úÖ Celebrate progress, don't punish gaps
```

### Instead of FOMO:
```
‚úÖ "You have time to decide"
‚úÖ "This will be available again"
‚úÖ Grace periods
```

## Final Reminder

**Dopamine engineering is POWERFUL.**

Used ethically: Helps people learn, grow, and achieve goals
Used unethically: Creates addiction, ruins lives, destroys wellbeing

**The choice is yours.**

**Test everything with: "Would I want this used on my family?"**

If the answer is no, don't build it.
