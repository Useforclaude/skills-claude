## Dopamine: The Molecule

**Chemical Structure:**
- Formula: C₈H₁₁NO₂
- Classification: Catecholamine neurotransmitter
- Precursor: L-tyrosine → L-DOPA → Dopamine
- Molecular weight: 153.18 g/mol

**Synthesis Pathway:**
1. Tyrosine (from diet)
2. Tyrosine hydroxylase → L-DOPA (rate-limiting step)
3. DOPA decarboxylase → Dopamine
4. Location: Synthesized in neuron cytoplasm

**Half-life:**
- Synaptic cleft: <1 second (rapid reuptake)
- Extracellular space: ~2-3 minutes
- Blood-brain barrier: Cannot cross (must be synthesized in brain)

## Dopamine Pathways in the Brain

### 1. Mesolimbic Pathway (Reward Pathway)

**Route:** VTA → Nucleus Accumbens → Amygdala → Hippocampus

**Function:**
- Reward processing
- Motivation
- Pleasure prediction
- Learning what's rewarding

**Key Structures:**

**Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA):**
- Origin of dopamine neurons
- ~20,000-50,000 neurons (0.0001% of brain)
- Fires in response to reward prediction

**Nucleus Accumbens (NAc):**
- "Pleasure center" (misnomer - actually motivation)
- Integrates reward signals
- Decision-making hub
- Subregions:
  - Shell: Reward liking
  - Core: Reward seeking

**Amygdala:**
- Emotional significance
- Fear conditioning
- Motivation intensity

**Hippocampus:**
- Memory formation
- Context associations
- "Where/when did I get reward?"

**Baseline Dopamine:** 50 nM
**Activated:** 100-300 nM (food, sex)
**Drugs:** 400-1200 nM (cocaine, meth)

**Addiction Mechanism:**
- Repeated high dopamine → tolerance
- Downregulation of D2 receptors (-15-20%)
- Need more stimulus for same effect
- Withdrawal = below-baseline dopamine

---

### 2. Mesocortical Pathway (Executive Function)

**Route:** VTA → Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)

**Function:**
- Planning
- Decision-making
- Impulse control
- Working memory

**Key Regions:**

**Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC):**
- Cognitive control
- Goal maintenance
- Delayed gratification

**Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC):**
- Value judgments
- Risk assessment
- Emotional regulation

**Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC):**
- Conflict monitoring
- Error detection
- Effort computation

**Addiction Impact:**
- Chronic substance use → PFC hypoactivity
- Result: Impaired impulse control
- "Can't stop even though I want to"
- Recovery: PFC function improves over 3-12 months abstinence

---

### 3. Nigrostriatal Pathway (Motor Control)

**Route:** Substantia Nigra → Dorsal Striatum (Caudate + Putamen)

**Function:**
- Movement initiation
- Motor learning
- Habit formation

**Habit Loop Connection:**
- Habits = automatic motor programs
- Checking phone = motor habit (dopamine-driven)
- After 66+ days → automatic (nigrostriatal dominance)

**Parkinson's Disease:**
- Loss of dopamine neurons in substantia nigra
- Result: Movement difficulties
- Treatment: L-DOPA (dopamine precursor)
- Side effect: Increased impulsivity (mesolimbic activation)

---

### 4. Tuberoinfundibular Pathway (Hormonal)

**Route:** Hypothalamus → Pituitary Gland

**Function:**
- Inhibits prolactin release
- Reproductive function
- Less relevant to addiction/engagement

---

## Dopamine Receptors

**5 Types:** D1, D2, D3, D4, D5

### D1-like (D1, D5): Excitatory
- **Location:** Striatum, cortex
- **Function:** "Go" signals, approach behavior
- **Effect:** Activates neurons
- **Role in addiction:** Craving, drug-seeking

### D2-like (D2, D3, D4): Inhibitory
- **Location:** Striatum, nucleus accumbens
- **Function:** "No-go" signals, inhibition
- **Effect:** Suppresses neurons
- **Role in addiction:** Tolerance, withdrawal

**Key Research Finding (Volkow et al., 2001):**
- Cocaine addicts: 15-20% fewer D2 receptors
- Low D2 = higher addiction vulnerability
- Genetic: DRD2 Taq1A allele (30% population)
- Effect: 30-40% fewer D2 receptors → novelty-seeking

---

## Dopamine Release Patterns

### Tonic vs Phasic Dopamine

**Tonic (Baseline):**
- **Level:** 50-100 nM
- **Pattern:** Slow, steady
- **Duration:** Continuous
- **Function:** Background motivation
- **Regulation:** Homeostatic mechanisms

**Phasic (Burst):**
- **Level:** 200-1000 nM
- **Pattern:** Rapid spikes (50-100ms)
- **Duration:** 0.5-3 seconds
- **Function:** Signals important events
- **Trigger:** Reward prediction errors

**Addiction Changes:**
- Tonic: Decreases (tolerance)
- Phasic: Increases to drug cues, decreases to natural rewards
- Result: "Nothing feels good except the drug/behavior"

---

## Prediction Error Coding

**Schultz et al. (1997) - Landmark Discovery:**

Dopamine neurons encode **prediction errors**, not reward itself!

**Formula:**
```
Dopamine Δ = Actual Reward - Expected Reward
```

**Three Scenarios:**

### 1. Unpredicted Reward (Positive Surprise)
```
Expected: 0
Actual: 10
Dopamine: +10 (burst firing 70-90Hz)

Effect: Strong learning
Memory: "Remember what led to this!"
```

### 2. Predicted Reward (No Surprise)
```
Expected: 10
Actual: 10
Dopamine: 0 (no change from baseline)

Effect: Confirmation, no new learning
Memory: "As expected, move on"
```

### 3. Reward Omission (Negative Surprise)
```
Expected: 10
Actual: 0
Dopamine: -10 (pause in firing)

Effect: Disappointment, update predictions
Memory: "Something wrong, be cautious"
```

**Application to Product Design:**

**Slot Machines:**
- Unpredictable wins → constant positive prediction errors
- Brain never habituates
- Every spin = potential surprise

**Social Media:**
- Variable content quality → prediction errors
- Sometimes great post (+dopamine)
- Sometimes boring (no dopamine)
- Sometimes friend update (big dopamine)
- Never know what's next → keep checking

## Dopamine and Time

### Temporal Discounting (Delay Discounting)

**Definition:** Future rewards are "discounted" in value

**Hyperbolic Discounting Formula:**
```
V = A / (1 + kD)

V = Present value
A = Actual value
k = Discount rate (individual difference)
D = Delay in time
```

**Example:**
```
$100 today vs $110 tomorrow:
- High k: Choose $100 (impulsive)
- Low k: Choose $110 (patient)

$100 in year vs $110 in year + 1 day:
- Both choose $110 (far future less discounted)
```

**Addiction Connection:**
- Addicts: Higher k (steep discounting)
- Effect: Prefer immediate gratification
- Drug > long-term health
- Check phone now > focused work later

**Research: Bickel et al. (2007):**
- Smokers discount 50% more steeply than non-smokers
- Heroin addicts: 2-3x steeper than controls
- Predictor of relapse (steeper = higher risk)

## Dopamine and Learning

### Reward-Based Learning

**Reinforcement Learning Model:**

**Q-Learning:**
```
Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]

Q(s,a) = Value of action a in state s
α = Learning rate (dopamine-modulated)
r = Reward
γ = Discount factor
```

**Dopamine's Role:**
- Dopamine spike = α (learning rate signal)
- Larger spike = faster learning
- No spike = no learning update

**Biological Implementation:**
- High dopamine → Long-term potentiation (LTP)
- LTP = Strengthening of synapses
- Result: Behavior repeated

### Habit Formation Timeline

**Balleine & O'Doherty (2010) - Goal-Directed to Habitual:**

**Phase 1: Goal-Directed (Days 1-30)**
- **Control:** Prefrontal cortex (mesocortical)
- **Flexibility:** High
- **Awareness:** Conscious
- **Dopamine:** Mesolimbic (reward prediction)

**Phase 2: Transition (Days 30-66)**
- **Control:** PFC + Striatum
- **Flexibility:** Medium
- **Awareness:** Partially conscious

**Phase 3: Habitual (Day 66+)**
- **Control:** Dorsal striatum (nigrostriatal)
- **Flexibility:** Low (stimulus-response)
- **Awareness:** Unconscious/automatic
- **Dopamine:** Nigrostriatal (habit execution)

**Breaking Habits:**
- Requires re-engaging PFC (System 2)
- Stress/fatigue → habit dominance
- New habit must be simpler than old habit

## Dopamine and Pleasure (The Distinction)

### Dopamine ≠ Pleasure

**Berridge & Robinson (1998) - Incentive Salience Theory:**

**"Wanting" (Dopamine):**
- Motivation to pursue
- Anticipation
- Reward seeking
- Can exist without pleasure

**"Liking" (Opioids):**
- Pleasure from consumption
- Hedonic experience
- Satisfaction
- Can exist without motivation

**Evidence:**

**Study 1: Dopamine Knockout Mice**
- Mice with no dopamine production
- Result: Still "like" sweet taste (facial expressions)
- But: Don't work to obtain food (no wanting)
- Conclusion: Dopamine not needed for pleasure

**Study 2: Dopamine Agonists**
- Give amphetamine (increases dopamine)
- Result: Increased wanting (work harder for reward)
- But: No increase in liking (same pleasure ratings)

**Study 3: Opioid Agonists**
- Give morphine (increases opioids)
- Result: Increased liking (higher pleasure)
- But: No increase in wanting (same motivation)

**Addiction Insight:**
- Addicts: High wanting, low liking
- "I don't even enjoy it anymore, but I can't stop"
- Dopamine system hijacked (want)
- Opioid system tolerant (don't like)

---

## Dopamine Tolerance and Sensitization

### Tolerance (Downregulation)

**Mechanism:**
1. Repeated high dopamine
2. D2 receptors internalized (endocytosis)
3. Receptor gene expression decreased
4. Result: Less sensitive to dopamine

**Timeline:**
- Acute: Within hours (receptor internalization)
- Chronic: Weeks-months (gene expression changes)
- Severe: 20-40% receptor loss (in addiction)

**Consequences:**
- Need more stimulus for same effect
- Natural rewards less satisfying
- Anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure)

### Sensitization (Upregulation of Salience)

**Mechanism:**
1. Drug-related cues become hyper-associated with reward
2. Cue alone triggers dopamine spike
3. VTA-NAc connection strengthened
4. Amygdala enhancement (emotional memory)

**Example:**
- Seeing drug paraphernalia → 70% dopamine spike (no drug yet!)
- Phone notification sound → 40% dopamine spike (before checking)
- Logo of favorite app → 25% dopamine spike

**Incentive-Sensitization Theory:**
- Tolerance: Liking decreases
- Sensitization: Wanting increases
- Result: "I want it more but like it less"
- Paradox drives addiction

- Impulsivity (r = 0.51)
- Reward sensitivity (r = 0.58)
- Addiction vulnerability (r = 0.39)

**Low Dopamine Reactivity:**
- Introversion
- Cautious behavior
- Low reward sensitivity
- Lower addiction risk (but higher depression risk)

## Dopamine Across Lifespan

### Development

**Childhood (0-12 years):**
- Dopamine system still developing
- Higher plasticity (easier to form associations)
- More vulnerable to addiction (if exposed)
- Risk: Early substance use → 4-7x addiction risk

**Adolescence (13-25 years):**
- Peak dopamine receptor density (age 15)
- Reward system mature, but PFC immature (until 25)
- Result: High risk-taking, low impulse control
- "Reward hot, brakes cold"
- Vulnerability: 90% of addictions start before age 25

**Adulthood (25-65 years):**
- Stable dopamine function
- Peak PFC control (30-40 years)
- Gradual decline: -10% receptors per decade
- Effect: Less novelty-seeking with age

**Elderly (65+ years):**
- D2 receptors: -30-40% vs youth
- Motor slowing (nigrostriatal)
- Less impulsive (lower dopamine drive)
- Medications: Careful with dopamine agonists (hallucinations risk)

## Dopamine Dysfunction Disorders

### Too Little Dopamine

**Parkinson's Disease:**
- Loss of substantia nigra neurons (nigrostriatal)
- Symptoms: Tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia
- Treatment: L-DOPA
- Side effects: Impulse control disorders (15% patients)

**Depression:**
- Low dopamine in mesolimbic/mesocortical
- Symptoms: Anhedonia, low motivation
- Not all depression (serotonin also involved)
- Treatment: Bupropion (dopamine reuptake inhibitor)

**ADHD:**
- Underactive dopamine in PFC (mesocortical)
- Symptoms: Inattention, hyperactivity
- Paradox: Stimulants (increase dopamine) → calmer
- Mechanism: PFC activation → better impulse control

### Too Much Dopamine

**Schizophrenia (Dopamine Hypothesis):**
- Hyperactive mesolimbic dopamine
- Symptoms: Hallucinations, delusions
- Treatment: D2 antagonists (antipsychotics)
- Side effects: Parkinsonism (also blocks nigrostriatal)

**Mania (Bipolar Disorder):**
- Elevated dopamine during manic episodes
- Symptoms: Hyperactivity, impulsivity, grandiosity
- Treatment: Mood stabilizers + antipsychotics

## Measuring Dopamine in Humans

### Techniques

**1. PET (Positron Emission Tomography):**
- Radioligand binds to dopamine receptors
- Measures: Receptor density, dopamine release
- Resolution: ~5mm
- Time: Minutes (slow)
- Research gold standard

**2. fMRI (Functional MRI):**
- Measures: Blood flow (indirect dopamine)
- NAc activation = proxy for dopamine
- Resolution: ~3mm
- Time: Seconds
- Widely available

**3. Microdialysis:**
- Direct dopamine measurement
- Only in animal studies (invasive)
- Resolution: <1mm
- Time: Seconds
- Most accurate

**4. Genetics:**
- Sequence dopamine-related genes
- Predict function (not measure)
- Individual differences

---

## Key Takeaways for Designers

**1. Dopamine = Anticipation, Not Pleasure**
- Design for the chase, not just the catch
- Build anticipation (previews, countdowns)

**2. Prediction Errors Drive Learning**
- Surprise > consistency
- Variable rewards > fixed rewards
- But: Don't over-surprise (causes anxiety)

**3. Tolerance Develops**
- What works today won't work in 3 months
- Need novelty or increased intensity
- Ethical: Stop escalating, help users quit

**4. Habits Form via Dopamine**
- Cue-based dopamine spikes
- After ~66 days, automatic
- Breaking habits requires PFC re-engagement

**5. Individual Differences Matter**
- Some users more vulnerable (genetic)
- Age matters (teens most vulnerable)
- Don't design for addicts
