## Level 1: Basic Segmentation (Start Here)

### 1. Engagement-Based Segmentation

**Segment Definition:**

**Hot Subscribers (Opened in last 30 days)**
- Characteristics: Active, engaged, recent openers
- Email frequency: 3-7x per week
- Content type: Mix of value and offers
- Expected open rate: 40-60%

**Warm Subscribers (Opened 30-90 days ago)**
- Characteristics: Moderately engaged
- Email frequency: 2-3x per week
- Content type: More value, less selling
- Expected open rate: 25-40%

**Cold Subscribers (No opens in 90+ days)**
- Characteristics: Inactive, possibly dead emails
- Email frequency: 1x per month (re-engagement)
- Content type: Re-engagement campaigns
- Expected open rate: 5-15%

**Workflow:**
```
Tag subscribers based on last open date
↓
Hot → Regular content + offers
Warm → Value-heavy content + occasional offers
Cold → Re-engagement sequence
↓
If cold subscribers don't engage after 3 attempts → Remove from list
```

**Tools:** Most ESPs have this built-in (ActiveCampaign, ConvertKit, etc.)

---

### 2. Purchase Behavior Segmentation

**Non-Buyers (Never purchased)**
- Focus: Education, trust-building, social proof
- Offers: Lead magnets, webinars, low-ticket items
- Sequence: Nurture → Soft sell → Hard sell

**One-Time Buyers**
- Focus: Product satisfaction, cross-sell, upsell
- Offers: Complementary products, upgrades
- Sequence: Thank you → Onboarding → Cross-sell

**Repeat Buyers (2+ purchases)**
- Focus: VIP treatment, loyalty rewards, exclusive access
- Offers: Early bird specials, bundle deals, premium products
- Sequence: VIP welcome → Exclusive offers → Referral requests

**High-Value Customers (Top 20% by revenue)**
- Focus: White-glove service, personalized outreach
- Offers: Premium products, 1-on-1 access, beta testing
- Sequence: Personal check-ins → Exclusive opportunities → Strategic asks

**Example Implementation:**
```
Shopify/WooCommerce/Stripe → Integrate with ESP
↓
Tag customers by:
- First purchase date
- Total purchases
- Total revenue
- Average order value
↓
Create segments:
- Non-buyers
- First-time buyers (last 30 days)
- Active customers (2+ purchases, last 90 days)
- VIPs (top 10% by revenue)
↓
Send targeted campaigns to each segment
```

### 3. Subscriber Source Segmentation

**Lead Magnet A Subscribers**
- Interest: Topic A
- Send: Content related to Topic A
- Offer: Product related to Topic A

**Lead Magnet B Subscribers**
- Interest: Topic B
- Send: Content related to Topic B
- Offer: Product related to Topic B

**Blog Subscribers**
- Interest: General content
- Send: Best blog posts, roundups
- Offer: Flagship product

**Webinar Attendees**
- Interest: Deep-dive learning
- Send: Webinar replays, case studies
- Offer: Course or coaching

**Social Media Followers Who Subscribed**
- Interest: Behind-the-scenes, personal
- Send: Stories, personal updates
- Offer: Community or membership

**Example Tagging System:**
```
Source Tag → Interest Tag → Content Strategy

LeadMagnet_EmailGrowth → Interest_EmailMarketing → Send email marketing content
LeadMagnet_ContentIdeas → Interest_ContentCreation → Send content creation tips
Webinar_ListBuilding → Interest_GrowthStrategies → Send growth tactics
```

---

## Level 2: Intermediate Segmentation

### 4. Behavioral Trigger Segmentation

**Link Click Segmentation**

If subscriber clicks link about [Topic A] → Tag as interested in Topic A
↓
Send more content about Topic A
↓
Offer product related to Topic A

**Example:**
```
Email: "3 Ways to Grow Your Email List"

Link 1: "Paid Ads Strategy" → Tag: Interest_PaidAds
Link 2: "Organic Growth Strategy" → Tag: Interest_Organic
Link 3: "Partnership Strategy" → Tag: Interest_Partnerships

Future emails personalized based on what they clicked
```

**Product Page Visit (via email)**

Subscriber clicks email → Visits Product A page → Doesn't buy
↓
Tag: ProductInterest_A
↓
Send Product A testimonials, case studies, objection handling
↓
Retarget with Product A specific campaign

**Cart Abandonment**

Subscriber adds to cart → Doesn't complete purchase
↓
Tag: CartAbandoner_ProductX
↓
Send abandoned cart sequence
↓
Offer incentive to complete

**Content Consumption**

Downloads resource → Tag based on resource type
Watches video → Tag based on video topic
Completes quiz → Tag based on quiz results

**Implementation:**
```
Most ESPs support behavioral automation:

1. Set up link tracking
2. Create automation rules:
   "If clicks link containing 'paid-ads' → Add tag 'Interest_PaidAds'"
3. Create segments from tags
4. Send targeted content to segments
```

### 5. Demographic Segmentation

**Industry**
- SaaS companies → Send SaaS case studies
- E-commerce → Send e-commerce strategies
- Coaches → Send coaching tactics

**Company Size**

**Location/Timezone**

- Progressive profiling (ask over time)

**Example:**
```
Signup Form:
- Email (required)
- Name (required)
- Industry (dropdown)
- Company size (dropdown)

Automation:
If Industry = "E-commerce" → Add to E-commerce segment
If Company Size = "1" → Add to Solopreneur segment
If Company Size = "10+" → Add to Agency segment

Send industry-specific content to each segment
```

## Level 3: Advanced Segmentation

### 7. Predictive Segmentation (Lead Scoring)

**How It Works:**
Assign points for actions, then segment by score

**Scoring System Example:**
```
Email opened: +5 points
Email link clicked: +10 points
Product page visited: +20 points
Watched demo video: +30 points
Added to cart: +50 points
Made purchase: +100 points

Decay: -2 points per week of inactivity
```

**Segments:**
```
Cold (0-20 points) → Re-engagement campaigns
Warm (21-50 points) → Educational content
Hot (51-99 points) → Product-focused emails
Buyer Ready (100+ points) → Sales team notification + hard sell
```

**Automation:**
```
ESP tracks points automatically
↓
When subscriber reaches 75+ points → Move to "Hot Leads" segment
↓
Trigger high-intent email sequence
↓
If score drops below 40 → Move back to nurture
```

**Tools:** HubSpot, ActiveCampaign, Drip (built-in scoring)

---

### 8. RFM Segmentation (E-commerce Gold Standard)

**RFM = Recency, Frequency, Monetary**

**Recency:** How recently did they purchase?
- 0-30 days = 5 points
- 31-60 days = 4 points
- 61-90 days = 3 points
- 91-180 days = 2 points
- 180+ days = 1 point

**Frequency:** How often do they purchase?
- 10+ times = 5 points
- 5-9 times = 4 points
- 3-4 times = 3 points
- 2 times = 2 points
- 1 time = 1 point

**Monetary:** How much do they spend?
- $1,000+ = 5 points
- $500-999 = 4 points
- $200-499 = 3 points
- $100-199 = 2 points
- $1-99 = 1 point

**RFM Score = R + F + M (max 15 points)**

**Segments:**
```
Champions (13-15 points):
- Recent, frequent, high-value buyers
- Strategy: Reward loyalty, ask for reviews, VIP treatment
- Email: Exclusive previews, beta access, personal outreach

Loyal Customers (10-12 points):
- Regular buyers, good value
- Strategy: Keep engaged, upsell
- Email: New products, bundle offers, early bird deals

Promising (7-9 points):
- Recent buyers, potential to increase
- Strategy: Nurture, encourage repeat purchase
- Email: Product education, cross-sell, incentives

At Risk (4-6 points):
- Haven't purchased recently
- Strategy: Re-engage before they're lost
- Email: "We miss you" campaigns, special offers

Lost (1-3 points):
- Inactive, low value
- Strategy: Win-back or remove
- Email: Aggressive win-back, then sunset
```

**Implementation:**
```
E-commerce platform → Calculate RFM monthly
↓
Sync with ESP (Klaviyo does this automatically)
↓
Create segments for each RFM tier
↓

### 10. Multi-Variable Segmentation (Combining Segments)

**Example 1: Source + Engagement**
```
Lead Magnet A + Hot Subscriber
→ Send: Advanced content on Topic A + Aggressive offers

Lead Magnet A + Cold Subscriber
→ Send: Re-engagement focused on Topic A

Lead Magnet B + Hot Subscriber
→ Send: Different content on Topic B + Different offers
```

**Example 2: Purchase History + Lead Score**
```
Customer + High Score (100+ points)
→ Send: Upsell campaign (they're primed to buy more)

Customer + Low Score (<30 points)
→ Send: Re-engagement, product education

Non-Buyer + High Score (80+ points)
→ Send: Hard sell, limited-time offer (they're close!)

Non-Buyer + Low Score
→ Send: Educational nurture sequence
```

**Example 3: Industry + Company Size + Goal**
```
E-commerce + Solopreneur + Goal_ListGrowth
→ Send: "How to grow email list as solo e-commerce owner"
→ Offer: Automated list-building course

Agency + 10+ employees + Goal_Revenue
→ Send: "How agencies 10x email revenue"
→ Offer: Enterprise consulting
```

**Creating Multi-Variable Segments:**
```
In most ESPs:

1. Create conditions:
   Tag contains "LeadMagnet_EmailGrowth"
   AND
   Last open date is within 30 days
   AND
   Total purchases equals 0

2. Name segment: "Hot_EmailGrowth_NonBuyers"

3. Create specific campaign for this segment
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too many segments too soon**
   - Start with 3-5 key segments
   - Add complexity gradually
   - Don't create segments you won't use

2. **Segment but don't personalize**
   - Creating segments is step 1
   - Must send different content to each
   - Otherwise segmentation is wasted

3. **Static segments (no automation)**
   - Subscribers should move between segments
   - Based on behavior and engagement
   - Set up automation to move people

4. **Over-segmentation**
   - Too small segments = not enough data
   - Minimum 100-200 people per segment
   - Consolidate tiny segments

5. **Ignoring segment performance**
   - Track open, click, conversion by segment
   - Double down on best performers
   - Fix or remove underperformers
