## Testing Framework

### How to Test Subject Lines

**Test Structure:**
1. Choose 2-3 formulas to test
2. Create variations for each
3. Split test 50/50 (or 33/33/33)
4. Minimum sample: 1,000 subscribers per variation
5. Track: Opens, clicks, conversions
6. Declare winner at 95% confidence

**Sample Size Calculator:**
- 1,000 subs per variation = minimum
- 5,000 subs per variation = good
- 10,000+ subs per variation = excellent

**Testing Priority:**
1. Test different categories first (Curiosity vs Urgency)
2. Then test formulas within category
3. Then test variations within formula
4. Finally test micro-variations (word choice, emoji)
