## Email 4: The Framework (Day 7)

### Purpose
- Deliver high-value content
- Position your method as solution
- Soft introduction to paid offering
- Build anticipation

### Template

**Subject:** Here's the framework that changed everything

**Preview:** (This is what took me from {before} to {after})

**Body:**
```
{Name},

Today I'm sharing the framework that transformed my {results}.

I call it the {Framework Name}:

┌─────────────────────────┐

│                         │
│  Step 1: {Action}       │
│     ↓                   │
│  Step 2: {Action}       │
│     ↓                   │
│  Step 3: {Action}       │
│     ↓                   │
│  Step 4: {Action}       │

└─────────────────────────┘

{2-3 paragraphs explaining the framework}

Example:
"Step 1 is about {explanation}. Most people skip this, which is
why they struggle with {problem}.

Step 2 builds on that foundation: {explanation}.

Step 3 is where the magic happens: {explanation}.

Finally, Step 4 {explanation}."

I know what you might be thinking:

"That sounds great, but will it work for ME?"

Great question.

Here's a quick story:

{Brief case study of someone who used this framework}

Example:
"Sarah was struggling with {problem}.

She implemented the {Framework Name} over 30 days.

Results:
→ {Specific result 1}
→ {Specific result 2}
→ {Specific result 3}

Here's what she said: '{Testimonial quote}'"

The framework works.

But here's the thing...

{Transition to introducing your paid offering}

Example:
"While you can implement this on your own (and many people do),
it's much faster and easier with the right guidance.

That's why I created {Product/Service Name}.

It's {brief description} designed to help you implement the
{Framework Name} in {timeframe} without {pain point}.

I'll tell you more about it in my next email.

For now, try implementing Step 1 of the framework and see what happens."

Talk soon,
{Your Name}

P.S. Over {number} people have used this framework to {achieve result}.
You can too. The first step: {actionable instruction}.
```

## Sequence Optimization Tips

### A/B Testing Priority

**Test these elements:**
1. Email 1 subject line (biggest impact on sequence success)
2. Email 5 CTA (biggest impact on conversions)
3. Email 4 framework delivery (complexity vs simplicity)
4. Send timing (morning vs evening)
5. Email length (short vs medium)

### Metrics to Monitor

**Overall Sequence Health:**
- Completion rate (% who read all 7 emails)
  - Good: 40%+
  - Excellent: 60%+
- Unsubscribe rate across sequence
  - Good: <1%
  - Excellent: <0.5%
- Conversion rate (% who buy by end)
  - Good: 3-5%
  - Excellent: 8-12%

**Individual Email Performance:**
- Track open rate progression (should stay above 35% by Email 7)
- Identify drop-off points
- Test and improve weak emails

### Customization Guidelines

**Adapt this sequence to your:**
- Voice (keep the structure, change the tone)
- Product type (course vs service vs physical product)
- Price point (higher price = longer nurture)
- Audience sophistication (beginner vs advanced)
- Brand personality (professional vs casual vs humorous)

**Keep these core elements:**
- Email 1: Deliver value immediately
- Email 2: Build connection through story
- Email 3: Provide education
- Email 4: Share framework/method
- Email 5: Present offer clearly
- Email 6: Social proof
- Email 7: Transition to regular content

**The sequence works because:**
1. Delivers immediate value (reciprocity)
2. Builds relationship (trust)
3. Establishes authority (expertise)
4. Provides social proof (safety)
5. Makes clear offer (clarity)
6. Removes friction (guarantee)

**Use this as your foundation, then make it your own.**
