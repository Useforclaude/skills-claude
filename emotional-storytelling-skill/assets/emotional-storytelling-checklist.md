# Emotional Storytelling Checklist

## Pre-Writing Phase

### Clarity
- [ ] I know which specific emotion I want to evoke
- [ ] I know why this emotion serves my goal
- [ ] I understand my audience's emotional starting point
- [ ] I have clear outcome (what should audience feel/do after)

### Foundation
- [ ] Story is true (or honestly framed as fiction/parable)
- [ ] I have permission to tell this (if involves others)
- [ ] Message aligns with my values authentically
- [ ] I'm telling this for right reasons (connection, not manipulation)

---

## Story Structure

### Beginning (Setup)
- [ ] Opens with hook (emotion visible immediately OR intriguing question)
- [ ] Establishes relatable character/situation
- [ ] Creates investment (why should audience care)
- [ ] Sets emotional baseline (where we're starting from)

### Middle (Build)
- [ ] Rising emotional intensity (doesn't stay flat)
- [ ] Specific obstacles/complications (not vague)
- [ ] Stakes are clear and personal
- [ ] Pacing varies (fast/slow for rhythm)
- [ ] Valleys before peaks (contrast amplifies emotion)

### Climax (Peak)
- [ ] Emotional peak at 70-80% mark
- [ ] Maximum tension or intensity
- [ ] Specific moment (not rushed through)
- [ ] Earned through sufficient build

### End (Resolution)
- [ ] Emotional release provided (catharsis)
- [ ] Resolution matches setup (payoff delivered)
- [ ] Meaning is clear (what was this about)
- [ ] Ends on intended emotion (what they'll remember)
- [ ] Satisfying completion (no loose emotional threads)
