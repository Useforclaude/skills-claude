4. **Focus on values over products** (what you stand for)
5. **Give emotional gift to audience** (transformation or permission)

4. **Exploit real suffering** (for commercial gain)
5. **Be clever at expense of emotion** (emotion > cleverness)
6. **Ignore brand heritage** (sudden values shift = inauthentic)
7. **Measure only short-term** (emotional branding is long game)
