## Viral Multipliers

### Multiplier 1: The Unexpected Twist

**Formula:** Setup expectation → Subvert completely → Revelation

**Example:**

**Why It Works:** Violated expectations = surprise = sharing

---

### Multiplier 2: The Scale Reveal

**Formula:** Start small → Reveal it's actually enormous → Mind blown

**Example:**
"This man saved $1. Every day. For 40 years. Seems small. Until you see: $14,600. Proof that small daily actions accumulate into life-changing results."

**Why It Works:** Makes abstract concrete, demonstrates possibility

### Multiplier 3: The Time Lapse

**Formula:** Before state → Time passage visible → After state

**Example:**
"Day 1: Planted seed. Day 30: Tiny sprout. Day 100: Small tree. Day 1000: Entire forest. Never underestimate what consistency builds."

**Why It Works:** Visual transformation, patience rewarded

### Multiplier 4: The Crowd Inclusion

**Formula:** Individual story → "You too" invitation → Community identity

**Example:**
"I started running. Couldn't do a mile. Now I run marathons. I'm not special. I'm just someone who started. Who else is ready to start? Comment 'ME' and let's support each other."

**Why It Works:** Transforms from watching to participating

- [ ] Am I representing people with dignity?

If any NO: Revise before publishing.

5. **Too Complex** - Simple stories spread, complex ones don't
6. **Self-Promotional** - Content about you vs for them
