### Example (Filled In)

Sarah had a stable job she didn't love. Things were fine. But she dreamed of starting her own design business.

Then she got laid off. Suddenly her choice was made. Sarah faced a decision: Find another safe job or finally try.  She decided to try.

The first client search failed. No one knew her work. The second month, she got one small project—barely paid rent. Third month, nothing. Sarah felt terrified. Six months in, savings nearly gone.

At month seven, everything seemed lost. Sarah stared at eviction notice, hands shaking. She cried for an hour. Maybe this was a sign to stop.

But then her phone rang. The one small client referred her to their network. "Your work changed our brand. We need you to tell others."

Within three months: Full client roster. Within a year: Waitlist. Sarah couldn't believe the photos—her work, her name, her business thriving.

Now, two years later, Sarah runs a six-figure design studio. Not just financially successful but creatively fulfilled. She took the leap that terrified her. Best decision of her life.
