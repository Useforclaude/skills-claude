## The Walk-In-Their-Shoes Framework

### Opening: The Universal Hook

"You think you know what [experience] is like. But let me show you."

OR

"Before you judge, walk with me through [character]'s day."

---

### Part 1: Morning Routine (Make Them Human)

[Character name] wakes at [time].
[First thought of the day - internal monologue]
[Physical sensation - what their body feels like]

**Specific details:**
- What do they see when they open their eyes?
- What's the first sound they hear?
- What's their first emotion of the day?

**Example:**
"Maria wakes at 4:30am. Her first thought: 'Did I pay the electricity?' Her back aches—three jobs, one old mattress. She sees the photo on her nightstand: Her kids, smiling. That's why she gets up."

---

### Part 2: The First Challenge (Build Empathy)

Before [most people] are [common activity], [character] is [their reality].

[Specific obstacle #1]
[What they think: internal monologue]
[What they do: action taken]
[How they feel: emotion named]

**Example:**
"Before most people are showered, Maria is on a bus across town. The morning shift at the hospital starts at 5:30. She thinks: 'If I miss this bus, I lose the shift. If I lose the shift, I can't pay rent.' She stands by the door, ready to run. Anxious doesn't cover it."

---

### Part 3: Accumulation (Let Challenges Build)

By [time], [character] has already [list of things accomplished/endured].
Now [next challenge].

**Show the math:**
- [Time spent on X]
- [Cost of Y]
- [Energy required for Z]
- Total: [overwhelming sum]

**Example:**
"By 2pm, Maria has cleaned 34 hospital rooms, taken a 15-minute bus ride to Job #2, and started a 4-hour shift at the grocery store. That's 11 hours. She has 5 more to go. The math: $9/hour × 16 hours = $144. Minus: $40 for daycare, $15 for bus fare, $10 for lunch. Take home: $79. For 16 hours."

---

### Part 4: The Invisible Decision

[Character] faces [choice most people never think about].

Option A: [do what seems obvious]
But that means [consequence]

Option B: [alternative]
But that means [different consequence]

[Character] chooses [what they chose].
[Why—the reasoning that makes sense in their context]

**Example:**
"At the grocery store, Maria watches a woman buy organic produce. Beautiful vegetables. $87 total. Maria thinks: 'That's more than I made today.' When her shift ends, Maria buys: Rice. Beans. Eggs. $12. Could she afford more nutritious food? Technically. But that would mean: No money for son's field trip. Or bus fare tomorrow. Or emergency fund for when kids get sick. She chooses $12 groceries. It's not lack of knowledge. It's math."

---

### Part 5: Evening (Show the Human Moment)

After [time period of work], [character] finally [gets home/to kids/to rest].

[Describe the moment - what does it look like?]
[What they want to do vs what they actually do]
[The moment of humanity - what makes them real]

**Example:**
"At 9:47pm, Maria finally opens her apartment door. Babysitter waiting. Kids asleep. She wants to collapse. Instead: Checks tomorrow's schedule. Preps breakfast. Sets out kids' clothes. Finally sits at 11:18pm. The house is quiet. For two minutes, she lets herself cry. Not from weakness. From exhaustion of being strong all day, every day."

---

### Part 6: The System (Zoom Out)

This isn't just [character]'s story.

[Statistic about how many people face this]
[Structural reasons this exists]
[What makes escape difficult]

**Example:**
"This isn't just Maria's story. 44% of U.S. workers are low-wage. They work full-time—often multiple jobs—and still can't afford basics. It's not laziness. It's wages not keeping up with cost of living. It's healthcare tied to employment. It's childcare costing more than wages. It's a system designed for people who don't exist anymore."

---

### Part 7: The Reframe (Change Perspective)

Next time you see [someone like character]:

Instead of thinking: [common judgment]
Consider: [alternative understanding]

Instead of asking: [problematic question]
Ask: [empathetic question]

**Example:**
"Next time you see someone using food stamps at the grocery store: Instead of thinking 'Why don't they just work harder?', consider: They might be working three jobs to your one. Instead of asking 'Why do they have a smartphone?', ask: 'How else would they find work, schedule shifts, or stay connected to their kids' schools?'"

---

### Part 8: The Invitation (What Now)

Now that you've walked a day in [character]'s life:

[What can audience do?]
[How can they help?]
[What can they change about their own perspective?]

**Example:**
"Now that you've walked a day in Maria's life: Maybe tip service workers a little more. Maybe vote for policies that raise minimum wage. Maybe just stop assuming you know someone's story from the outside. Maybe recognize: The difference between you and Maria might be luck, not virtue."

## Empathy Story Elements Checklist

**To build empathy, include:**
- [ ] **Specific Details** (not generic - paint vivid picture)

- [ ] **Physical Sensation** (what their body feels like)
- [ ] **Time/Money Math** (make abstract concrete)
- [ ] **Moments of Humanity** (what makes them fully human)
- [ ] **Structural Context** (not just individual, show system)

**To maintain empathy, avoid:**
- [ ] Pity language ("poor them")
- [ ] Savior complex ("I will rescue")
- [ ] Poverty porn (gratuitous suffering detail)
- [ ] Reducing to stereotype
- [ ] Removing agency (only victim, no choices)
- [ ] Comparing suffering ("others have it worse")
