{if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?
n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};
if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';
n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;
t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];
s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script',
'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
fbq('init', 'YOUR_PIXEL_ID');
fbq('track', 'PageView');
</script>

## üìç Placement Optimization

### **Automatic Placements vs Manual:**

**Start:** Automatic (let FB optimize)

**After data:** Manual (turn off losers)

### **Placement Performance Ranking (General):**

1. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Facebook Feed** (highest engagement)
2. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Instagram Feed**

6. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Facebook Right Column**

### **When to Use Manual Placements:**

- App installs: Stories + Reels (full screen)
- Lead gen: Feed only (forms work better)

---

## üí∞ Budget & Bidding Strategy

**How it works:**
Set budget at campaign level ‚Üí FB auto-distributes to best ad sets

**When to use:**
- ‚úÖ Scaling proven campaigns
- ‚úÖ Multiple similar audiences
- ‚úÖ Budget > $50/day

**When NOT to use:**
- ‚ùå Testing new audiences (use ABO)
- ‚ùå Very different audiences
- ‚ùå Budget < $20/day

---

### **Ad Set Budget Optimization (ABO)**

**How it works:**
Set individual budgets per ad set

**When to use:**
- ‚úÖ Testing phase
- ‚úÖ Very different audiences (cold vs warm)
- ‚úÖ Want manual control
- ‚úÖ Small budgets

---

### **Budget Guidelines:**

| Campaign Type | Minimum Daily Budget | Recommended |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Testing new audience | $10/day | $20-50/day |
| Retargeting | $5/day | $10-30/day |
| Scaling winner | $50/day | $100-500/day |
| Lookalike testing | $20/day | $50-100/day |

**Budget Scaling Rule:**
Don't increase budget more than **20% per day** (causes learning reset)

```
Day 1: $50
Day 2: $60 (20% increase) ‚úÖ
Day 3: $72 (20% increase) ‚úÖ
NOT: Day 2: $100 (100% increase) ‚ùå
```

---

### **Bidding Strategies:**

| Strategy | How It Works | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Lowest Cost** | FB gets cheapest results | Testing, small budgets |
| **Cost Cap** | Max cost per result | Profit margin control |
| **Bid Cap** | Max bid per auction | Advanced, high competition |
| **Target Cost** | Avg cost target | Stable CPA needed |

**Recommendation:** Start with **Lowest Cost** ‚Üí Switch to **Cost Cap** after data.

**Setup:**
- Implement on your server
- Use Facebook Conversion API
- Send events directly to FB (not via pixel)

#### **2. Aggregated Event Measurement**
- Verify domain

#### **3. Modeling & Estimation**
FB estimates conversions (modeled data)

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **1. Audience Too Narrow**

### **2. Not Enough Budget**
‚ùå $5/day testing 5 ad sets ($1/day each)

### **3. Changing Too Soon**
‚ùå Editing ad after 1 day
‚úÖ Wait 3-7 days for data
