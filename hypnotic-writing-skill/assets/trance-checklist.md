Is scarcity real and ethical?

- [ ] **2 pts:** True scarcity (limited spots, time-based, one-time offer)
- [ ] **1 pt:** Soft scarcity (price increase, bonus removal)
- [ ] **0 pts:** Fake scarcity or none

**Real Scarcity:**
- Cohort-based (only 50 spots)
- Time-based (offer expires when video ends)
- Resource-limited (your time for Q&A)
- One-time (legitimate)

**Fake Scarcity (Avoid):**
- Evergreen countdown that resets
- "Only X left" when unlimited
- "Final chance" that repeats

**Check:**
- [ ] Is the scarcity claim verifiable?
- [ ] Would you feel ethical stating it publicly?
- [ ] Does it create urgency without manipulation?

---

### 9.2 Consequence of Inaction (2 points)

Is the cost of not acting made clear?

- [ ] **2 pts:** Vivid negative future if they don't act
- [ ] **1 pt:** Some consequence mentioned
- [ ] **0 pts:** No inaction consequence

**Consequence Types:**

- **Escalation:** "This problem gets worse, not better, with time"
- **Competitive:** "Others are implementing this while you're deciding"
- **Financial:** "You'll spend more trying other things"

**Pattern:**
"So you have a choice. Act now and [positive future]. Or wait, and [negative future]. Which would you prefer?"

**Check:**
- [ ] Is negative future specific and vivid?
- [ ] Does it create contrast with positive future?
- [ ] Is it ethical (not fear-mongering)?

---

### 9.3 Urgency Placement (2 points)

Is urgency introduced at optimal moments?

- [ ] **2 pts:** Urgency in 3+ locations (early mention, pre-price, at CTA)
- [ ] **1 pt:** Urgency in 1-2 locations
- [ ] **0 pts:** No urgency or only at very end

**Strategic Placement:**
1. **Early:** "This offer is time-limited" (plants seed)
2. **Pre-Price:** "Price increases after video" (frames value)
3. **At CTA:** "Click now to get this price" (triggers action)
4. **Post-CTA:** "Remember, this expires when..." (final push)

**Check:**
- [ ] Is urgency established before price?
- [ ] Is it reinforced multiple times?
- [ ] Does each mention add detail/specificity?

---

### 9.4 Future Regret (2 points)

Is potential future regret evoked?

- [ ] **2 pts:** Clear future regret scenario

- [ ] **0 pts:** No regret evoked

**Regret Pattern:**
"Imagine it's [time period] from now. You didn't take action today. You're still [problem]. And you think back to this moment... this decision... and you wonder... 'What if I had just clicked that button?'"

**Why This Works:**
- People are more motivated to avoid regret than gain pleasure
- Future regret is more painful than present discomfort
- Makes inaction feel risky instead of safe

**Check:**
- [ ] Is specific time period mentioned?
- [ ] Is the regretted decision explicit?
- [ ] Does it contrast with alternative positive future?

---

**Assumptive Patterns:**
- "When you click below..."
- "Once you're inside..."
- "After you join..."

**Avoid:**

Is there a command stack before CTA?

- [ ] **2 pts:** 3+ embedded commands in sentences before CTA
- [ ] **1 pt:** 1-2 commands
- [ ] **0 pts:** No commands before CTA

**Final Stack Example:**
