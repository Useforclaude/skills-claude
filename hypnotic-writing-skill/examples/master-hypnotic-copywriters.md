### Example 1: The Coat of Arms Letter

**Original Copy (Excerpts):**

```
Dear Friend,

I'll bet I can tell you something about yourself that you didn't know!

Did you know that your last name is an official "coat of arms" name?

It's true! And listen: I have recently received, from Great Britain, information about a fantastically beautiful book which contains your coat-of-arms, in full color, plus lots of fascinating information about the origins of your last name.

Here's some neat facts about this book:

First of all, it is a beautiful coffee-table book that will look great anywhere you decide to display it.

Secondly, it contains, printed in lovely, full color, an exact reproduction of YOUR FAMILY'S coat of arms!

And thirdly, listen to this: You know, I think I would enjoy owning a book like this just to see what my coat of arms looks like but, what really makes this worthwhile, is all the detailed information about the origins of your name and what your last name was famous for in the old days!

Doesn't that sound interesting?
```

**Hypnotic Elements Analysis:**

**1. Opening Pattern Interrupt:**
"I'll bet I can tell you something about yourself that you didn't know!"

- **Why It Works:** Curiosity spike + challenge to reader's knowledge
- **Trance Effect:** Attention capture, engagement, openness to new information

**2. Pacing (Acknowledging Reality):**
"Did you know that your last name is an official 'coat of arms' name?"

- **Why It Works:** For many readers, this IS true (pacing reality)
- **Trance Effect:** "He knows about me" → rapport building

**3. Conversational Rhythm:**
"It's true! And listen: I have recently received..."

- **Why It Works:** Casual language ("And listen") creates intimacy
- **Trance Effect:** Feels like friend sharing news, not salesman pitching

**4. Embedded Commands:**
- "listen to this"
- "Doesn't that sound interesting?"

- **Why They Work:** Direct attention and assume interest
- **Trance Effect:** Reader follows instructions unconsciously

**5. Future Pacing:**
"...a beautiful coffee-table book that will look great anywhere you decide to display it"

- **Why It Works:** Reader imagines ownership ("where you decide to display")
- **Trance Effect:** Mental rehearsal of ownership increases desire

**6. Repetitive Rhythm Pattern:**
"First of all... Secondly... And thirdly, listen to this:"

- **Why It Works:** Creates predictable structure (brain relaxes into pattern)
- **Trance Effect:** Hypnotic rhythm through enumeration

### Example 2: The "Tova" Letter

**Original Copy (Excerpt):**

```
Dear Friend,

I am a 54 year old woman, and I am supposed to have wrinkles... right?

WRONG!

The truth is, I don't have a single wrinkle anywhere on my face!

And listen: I don't use plastic surgery, I don't use shots, I don't use lasers and I don't use face lifts.

So, how do I do it?

Simple. I'll tell you. I use a special skin care regimen developed by a brilliant Swedish woman named Tova Borgnine.
```

**Hypnotic Elements Analysis:**

**1. Identity Pacing:**
"I am a 54 year old woman, and I am supposed to have wrinkles... right?"

- **Why It Works:** Acknowledges conventional wisdom (pacing)
- **Trance Effect:** Reader thinks "Yes, that's what I believe" (agreement trance)

**2. Pattern Interrupt:**
"WRONG!"

- **Why It Works:** Violates expectation
- **Trance Effect:** Attention spike, heightened receptivity

**3. Proof Statement:**
"The truth is, I don't have a single wrinkle anywhere on my face!"

- **Why It Works:** Bold claim creates curiosity
- **Trance Effect:** "How is this possible?" → open loop

**4. Preemptive Objection Handling:**
"I don't use plastic surgery, I don't use shots, I don't use lasers and I don't use face lifts."

- **Why It Works:** Eliminates explanations reader would generate
- **Trance Effect:** Closes alternative explanations, focuses attention on coming revelation

**5. Open Loop + Promise:**
"So, how do I do it? Simple. I'll tell you."

- **Why It Works:** Creates open loop then promises closure
- **Trance Effect:** Brain craves closure → reader committed to continue

---

### Gary Halbert's Key Lessons

**1. Write Like You Talk**
Conversational = Low resistance = Hypnotic

**2. Use "Listen" as Attention Director**
"And listen:" or "Now listen:" → Commands attention without seeming like command

**3. Build Rapport Through Common Enemy**
"You and I know [truth], but they don't want you to know..."

**4. Ask Questions, Then Answer Them**
Creates rhythm and guides thinking:
- "Why does this matter?" → "Here's why..."
- "How does it work?" → "Simple..."

**5. Future Pace Ownership**
Don't say "when you buy." Say "when you display" or "when you use."

At 10:30 last Tuesday night, 618 people became instant geniuses!

At that moment, each of these men and women discovered how to unlock the vast storehouse of INTELLIGENCE lying dormant within their own minds!

They proved that the human brain is naturally capable of:

Photographic memory ... instantaneous mathematical calculation ... absolute perfect recall ... SPEED READING at up to 50,000 words per minute ... lightning-fast learning ... and SO MUCH MORE!

And here's the best part: YOU can develop these same mental powers -- starting tonight!
```

**Hypnotic Elements Analysis:**

**1. Specificity Creates Believability:**
"At 10:30 last Tuesday night, 618 people..."

- **Why It Works:** Specific details bypass skepticism
- **Trance Effect:** Feels real/documented rather than marketing fluff

**2. Identity Transformation:**
"...became instant geniuses!"

- **Why It Works:** Promises identity-level change
- **Trance Effect:** Appeals to deep desire for transformation

"Photographic memory ... instantaneous mathematical calculation ... absolute perfect recall ..."

- **Trance Effect:** Rhythm builds, each item adds to mounting desire

**6. Inclusive Promise:**
"YOU can develop these same mental powers -- starting tonight!"

### Example 2: Boardroom Reports

**Original Copy (Excerpt):**

```
What Never To Eat On An Airplane

(And 1,847 other MONEY-MAKING ideas you never learned in school!)

What is the REAL difference between people who make $25,000 a year and people who make $250,000 a year?

Is it education? NO! Some of the richest men in the world never graduated from high school!

Is it luck? NO! Most wealthy people created their own opportunities!

Is it who they know? PARTLY! But even more important is WHAT THEY KNOW!

They know secrets. Insider secrets. The kind of money-making secrets that schools don't teach ... that your boss doesn't know ... that separate the wealthy from everyone else!

And now YOU can know these secrets too!
```

**Hypnotic Elements Analysis:**

**1. Curiosity-Driven Headline:**
"What Never To Eat On An Airplane"

- **Why It Works:** Odd specificity creates curiosity

- **Trance Effect:** Builds rapport through shared knowledge

**5. Identity Separation:**
"...separate the wealthy from everyone else!"

- **Why It Works:** Implies knowledge = wealth class distinction
- **Trance Effect:** Acquiring knowledge = joining wealthy class

**6. Inclusive Invitation:**
"And now YOU can know these secrets too!"

- **Why It Works:** "Too" implies joining exclusive group
- **Trance Effect:** Desire for inclusion in "in-group"

---

### Eugene Schwartz's Key Lessons

**1. Identify the Mass Desire**
What does everyone in this market want but can't articulate?

**2. Educate to Build Desire**
Don't just claim benefits. Teach WHY those benefits matter.

**3. Use Precise Language**
"Unlock" vs. "use" → One is more hypnotic (implies ease)
"Discover" vs. "learn" → One is more hypnotic (implies revelation)

**4. The Ellipsis Technique**
Use "..." to create rhythm and pauses that build hypnotic momentum.

**5. Ask Questions, Give Emphatic Answers**
Creates engagement and guides thinking toward your conclusion.

### Example 1: BluBlocker Sunglasses

**Original Copy (Excerpt):**

```
It was one of those days.

I was flying my airplane and the sun was beating down on my face.

The glare was terrible.

Even with my expensive Polaroid aviator sunglasses, I couldn't see clearly.

I was squinting badly.

That's when my friend, a NASA test pilot, reached into his flight bag and handed me something.

"Try these," he said.

I put them on.

Suddenly, everything changed.

The glare disappeared instantly. Colors became vivid. Details jumped out.

I could see everything with crystal clarity.

"What are these?" I asked.

He smiled. "They're BluBlockers. Amazing, aren't they?"

I nodded. I had to have them.

That day I ordered 1,000 pairs.
```

**Hypnotic Elements Analysis:**

**1. The Slippery Slide Structure:**
Notice how each sentence is short and pulls you to the next:

"It was one of those days." → What kind of day?
"I was flying my airplane..." → Interesting! Tell me more.
"The glare was terrible." → Problem identified.

- **Why It Works:** No natural stopping point
- **Trance Effect:** Momentum builds, critical thinking shuts off

**2. Sensory Details:**
"...sun was beating down on my face"
"I was squinting badly"
"Colors became vivid"

- **Why They Work:** Create mental movie (visualization)

### Example 2: JS&A Space Pen

**Original Copy (Excerpt):**

```
You're on a space station.

You need to write something down.

You reach for your pen.

It doesn't work.

Why? Because ink won't flow in zero gravity.

NASA spent millions developing a pen that writes in space.

The Russians? They used a pencil.

But there's a problem with pencils in space. The graphite particles float around. They get into equipment. They short circuit electronics.

So NASA's investment wasn't wasteful. It was essential.

And now, you can own the same pen used by astronauts.

The Fisher Space Pen.

It writes underwater. It writes upside down. It writes in extreme temperatures.

And yes, it writes in zero gravity.

Will you ever go to space? Probably not.

But you will write upside down. You will write in rain. You will write in cold.

And this pen will work when others fail.
```

**Hypnotic Elements Analysis:**

**1. Imaginative Engagement:**
"You're on a space station."

- **Why It Works:** Second-person present tense = mental simulation
- **Trance Effect:** Reader enters imagined scenario

**2. Short Sentence Rhythm:**
"You need to write something down. You reach for your pen. It doesn't work."

- **Why It Works:** Rapid pace prevents critical thinking
- **Trance Effect:** Swept along by momentum

**3. The "Why?" Technique:**
"Why? Because ink won't flow in zero gravity."

- **Why It Works:** Satisfies curiosity immediately after creating it
- **Trance Effect:** Trained to keep reading for answers

**4. Story Within Story:**
NASA vs. Russian pencil story

- **Why It Works:** Interesting tangent maintains engagement
- **Trance Effect:** Educational distraction while building value

**5. Objection Preemption:**
"Will you ever go to space? Probably not."

- **Why It Works:** Addresses obvious objection before reader raises it
- **Trance Effect:** Eliminates resistance before it forms

**6. Practical Translation:**
"But you will write upside down. You will write in rain."

- **Why It Works:** Translates exotic feature to everyday benefit
- **Trance Effect:** Makes extraordinary relevant to ordinary life

---

### Joe Sugarman's Key Lessons

**1. The First Sentence Rule**
First sentence only job: Make them read the second sentence.

**2. Vary Sentence Length for Rhythm**
Short. Short. Short. Longer sentence with detail. Short.

**3. Tell Stories, Not Features**
Don't say "waterproof." Tell story of writing in rain.

**4. Preempt Every Objection**
Address it before reader thinks of it.

**5. Use "You" and Present Tense**
"You're on a space station" not "Imagine being on a space station"

Dear Friend,

I'm going to make a prediction that will sound crazy.

But mark my words: Within the next 87 days, you're going to see a financial event that will make the 2008 crash look like a hiccup.

And when it happens, most Americans will be financially devastated.

Their 401(k)s will be cut in half. Their home values will plummet. Their jobs will disappear.

But a small group of Americans -- those who see what's coming -- will actually PROFIT from the chaos.

Some will double their money. Some will triple it. A few will multiply their wealth ten-fold.

Which group will you be in?

The choice you make in the next 10 minutes determines everything.
```

**6. Escalating Benefit:**
"Some will double... Some will triple... A few will multiply ten-fold"

- **Why It Works:** Shows range of outcomes, all positive
- **Trance Effect:** Even conservative outcome (double) is attractive

**7. Choice Illusion:**
"Which group will you be in?"

- **Why It Works:** Presents binary choice (profit or devastation)
- **Trance Effect:** Eliminates middle ground, forces decision

**8. Time Pressure:**
"The choice you make in the next 10 minutes determines everything."

- **Why It Works:** Creates immediate urgency
- **Trance Effect:** Fear of missing out overrides deliberation

### Example 2: Health Breakthrough

**Original Copy (Excerpt):**

```
What I'm about to tell you is going to make a lot of powerful people very angry.

But I don't care. Because this information could save your life.

Big Pharma has known about this natural compound for 30 years.

They've buried the research. Silenced the scientists. And kept it from you.

Why? Because if this information got out, it would destroy their $500 billion drug empire overnight.

This natural compound -- found in a common plant you probably walk past every day -- has been shown in 47 separate studies to:

✓ Reduce inflammation by up to 82%
✓ Eliminate chronic pain in 93% of users
✓ Reverse arterial plaque buildup
✓ Boost immune function by 340%

And it does all this with ZERO side effects.

No prescription needed. No doctor visits. No insurance hassles.

Just nature's perfect medicine, the way it was meant to be.

But here's the problem: Big Pharma is lobbying to make this compound illegal.

If they succeed, you'll never have access to it.

That's why you need to act today.
```

---

### Clayton Makepeace's Key Lessons

**1. Identify the Enemy**
People unite against common enemies. Give them one.

Not "a lot of studies" → "47 separate studies"
Not "most users" → "93% of users"

**3. Escalate Emotional Intensity**
Start with concern, build to fear, peak at urgency.

**4. Create Forbidden Knowledge Frame**
"They don't want you to know" increases perceived value.

**5. Use Visual Formatting for Benefits**
Checkmarks, bullets, bold → Guides eye and suggests verification.

**Original Copy (Excerpt):**

```
"Amazing Secret Discovered By One-Legged Golfer Adds 50 Yards To Your Drives, Eliminates Hooks and Slices... And Can Slash Up To 10 Strokes From Your Game Almost Overnight!"

Dear Frustrated Golfer,

Finally, I'm going to let you in on a secret that the golf pros have been hiding from you for years.

It's going to make you mad.

In fact, when you realize how simple this is, and how long you've been lied to, you might want to punch your local pro in the nose.

But here's the thing: He probably doesn't even know this secret himself.

Because the golf industry -- from equipment manufacturers to the PGA -- has a vested interest in keeping you confused.

Confused golfers buy more clubs. Take more lessons. Buy more books.

A golfer with a simple, consistent swing? He's not a good customer anymore.

So they've complicated everything to keep you coming back.

But I'm about to blow the lid off this scam.

And show you the ridiculously simple secret that can transform your game literally overnight.

Ready?

It's not your swing that's the problem.

It's your instructor.

### Example 2: "Kick Butt" Business Copy

**Original Copy (Excerpt):**

```
How A Lazy S.O.B. Who Never Worked A Day In His Life Accidentally Stumbled Onto A "Secret Formula" That Allows Him To Pull Down Six Figures A Year Working Less Than 20 Hours Per Week...

... And How YOU Can Steal This Formula And Use It To Transform Your Own Business Into A Money-Sucking Machine!

Listen up.

I'm not a guru.

I'm not some MBA-wielding corporate drone.

And I'm certainly not one of those rah-rah motivational idiots who tells you to "follow your passion" and "dream big."

That's all garbage.

Here's the truth: I'm a lazy guy who stumbled onto something that works.

And I've milked it for everything it's worth.

No 60-hour weeks. No stress. No employees to babysit.

Just a simple system that prints money while I'm at the beach.

Sound good?

I thought so.

Now, before you get too excited, I need to warn you: This isn't for everyone.

If you're the type who needs to "feel productive" by sitting in an office 50 hours a week, this isn't for you.

If you need validation from a boss or co-workers, this isn't for you.

If you can't handle people thinking you're lazy (even though you're making more money than all of them combined), this isn't for you.

But if you're okay being misunderstood by the sheep...

If you're okay with working smarter instead of harder...

If you're okay with your friends being jealous of your lifestyle...

Then keep reading.

Because I'm about to hand you the blueprint.

"If you need validation from a boss... this isn't for you."
"If you're okay being misunderstood by the sheep..."

- **Why It Works:** Creates in-group (smart rebels) vs. out-group (sheep)
- **Trance Effect:** Desire to be in superior group

### John Carlton's Key Lessons

**1. Embrace Personality**
Don't be bland. Be opinionated, edgy, real.

**2. Use Pattern Interrupts**
Start with something shocking that violates expectations.

**3. Create Common Enemies**
Gurus, authorities, conventional wisdom -- unite readers against them.

**4. Disqualify to Qualify**
"This isn't for you if..." makes people want to prove they ARE qualified.

**5. Anti-Hero Positioning**
"I'm not special, I just found something that works" → More relatable than guru.

### Example 1: Marketing Consultation

**Original Copy (Excerpt):**

```
READ THIS CAREFULLY -- IT WILL EITHER MAKE YOU VERY RICH OR VERY ANGRY

If you are a business owner who is SERIOUS about making MORE MONEY with LESS EFFORT... and you're SICK AND TIRED of all the "marketing gurus" who promise big results but deliver only confusion and empty theories...

Then PAY CLOSE ATTENTION to what I'm about to tell you.

My name is Dan Kennedy, and I've helped over 1,000 business owners add six to seven figures to their bottom line using the exact strategies I'm about to share with you.

But before I reveal these strategies, I need to know if you're the RIGHT KIND of business owner.

Because these strategies aren't for everyone.

They're not for people who want to "build their brand" or "increase engagement" or any of that corporate marketing fluff.

These strategies are for business owners who want ONE THING and ONE THING ONLY:

MORE MONEY IN THE BANK. NOW.

If that's you, keep reading.

If not, stop wasting your time and mine, and go back to your branding consultant.

Still here? Good.

That tells me you're serious.

So here's my offer: I'm going to give you 60 minutes of my time -- time I normally charge $5,000 for -- absolutely FREE.

Why? Two reasons.

First, I'm testing a new consulting program and I need 10 case studies.

Second, I enjoy working with serious business owners who take action.

But here's the catch: I only have time for 10 people. And these 10 spots will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis.

No exceptions. No wait list. No second chances.

So here's what you need to do RIGHT NOW:

Call this number: XXX-XXX-XXXX

Ask for Sarah and tell her you're calling about the FREE 60-minute strategy session.

She'll ask you 3 qualifying questions. If you qualify, you're in.

If not, sorry -- I can only help business owners who meet my criteria.

Do this NOW. Not later today. Not tomorrow. NOW.

Because by tomorrow, all 10 spots will be gone.

And you'll be wondering "what if?" for the rest of your life.

Your move.

Dan Kennedy

### Dan Kennedy's Key Lessons

**1. Use Direct Commands**
Don't hint. Command: "Do this now."

**2. Qualify Your Reader**
"Are you the right kind of person?" → Makes them want to prove they are.

**3. Create Real (or Believable) Scarcity**
Limited spots, limited time, limited availability.

**4. Use "Reason Why"**
Always explain why you're making the offer. Satisfies logic.

**5. Hard Deadline + Consequence**
"By tomorrow, all spots will be gone and you'll regret it."

## How to Model Their Techniques

### The Modeling Process

**Step 1: Collect Examples**
Find 10+ pieces from the copywriter you want to model.

**Step 2: Annotate**
Mark every hypnotic technique you recognize:
- [Pace] for pacing statements
- [Lead] for leading statements
- [Command] for embedded commands
- [Pattern Interrupt] for attention grabs
- [Rhythm] for sentence structure patterns
- Etc.

**Step 3: Identify Patterns**
What techniques does this copywriter use most?
What's their signature style?

**Step 4: Extract Templates**
Turn their patterns into fill-in-the-blank templates.

**Example from Gary Halbert:**
```
Template: "Did you know that [surprising fact about reader]? It's true! And listen: [revelation about your product]..."
```

**Step 5: Practice**
Write using their templates for your products.

**Step 6: Adapt**
Once you've mastered their style, blend it with your own voice.
