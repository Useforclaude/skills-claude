## Headline Psychology

### What Makes a Headline Hypnotic?

**Regular headlines inform or intrigue.**
**Hypnotic headlines ALTER MENTAL STATE.**

**Four Mechanisms of Hypnotic Headlines:**

**1. Pattern Interrupts**
Violate expectations → Spike attention → Create openness to suggestion

**2. Embedded Commands**
Hidden imperatives that bypass conscious resistance

**3. Confusion**
Temporary disorientation → Heightened suggestibility

**4. Identity Activation**
Trigger specific self-concept → Reader acts from that identity

### The Headline Formula Structure

Each formula includes:
- **[BLANK]** = Fill in your specific content
- **Hypnotic Element** = Why it works

### Testing Protocol

**A/B Test Components:**
1. Curiosity vs. Clarity
2. Short vs. Long
3. Question vs. Statement
4. Specific vs. General
5. You vs. How To

**Winner = Highest click-through rate from your specific audience**
