## Ethical Commitment

**These are called "weapons" because they can harm.**

Before using any weapon, pass it through:

**The 4 Tests**
1. **Truth Test:** Is every claim factually accurate?
2. **Benefit Test:** Will the customer actually benefit?
3. **Autonomy Test:** Am I respecting their right to choose?
4. **Transparency Test:** Would I be comfortable if exposed?

**If you can't pass all 4 tests, don't publish.**
