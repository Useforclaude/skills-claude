## RECIPROCITY IN ACTION

### Example 1: HubSpot's Free CRM Strategy

**The Tactic:**
Give away professional-grade CRM software completely free (worth $1,000+/year).

**Weapons Used:**
- **Reciprocity (primary):** Massive value given before any ask
- **Authority:** Professional tool establishes expertise
- **Commitment:** Using free CRM = invested in HubSpot ecosystem

**The Ask:**
After 6-12 months of free use, upgrade to paid Marketing Hub ($800-2,000/month).

**Why It Works:**
- Value delivered: $1,000+/year
- Reciprocity debt accumulated over months
- By time of ask, users feel they "owe" HubSpot
- Switching cost high (data locked in)

**Results:**
- $1.7B annual revenue
- 140,000+ customers
- Free CRM has over 1M users

**Lesson:** Give away the store for free. Monetize the premium layer. Reciprocity at scale.

### Example 2: Costco's Free Sample Strategy

**The Tactic:**
Hire staff to cook and distribute free food samples throughout store.

**Weapons Used:**
- **Reciprocity (primary):** Free food creates obligation
- **Social proof:** Other customers crowding sample stations
- **Liking:** Friendly sample staff
- **Commitment:** Trying product = micro-commitment

**The Results:**
- Products with samples see 200-2,000% sales lift
- Customers spend 20-30% more on entire trip
- Multi-million dollar program pays for itself many times over

**Why It Works:**
- $0.50 of free food → $20 product purchase (40X ROI)
- Reciprocity triggers even if customer didn't want sample
- Taste = commitment to liking the product

**Lesson:** Physical gifts (food) trigger stronger reciprocity than digital.

---

### Example 3: Dropbox's Referral Program

**The Tactic:**
Give 500MB free storage for every friend referred (both referrer and referee).

**Weapons Used:**
- **Reciprocity:** Free storage = gift
- **Social proof:** "Your friend recommended this"
- **Commitment:** Using Dropbox = invested

**The Results:**
- 35% signup increase from referrals
- Went from 100,000 to 4,000,000 users in 15 months
- 60% of signups came from referrals

**Why It Works:**
- Dual reciprocity (both parties get gift)
- Referrer feels they're giving friend a gift
- Friend feels obligated to try it (referrer recommended it)

**Lesson:** Make reciprocity viral by rewarding both sides.

---

## COMMITMENT & CONSISTENCY IN ACTION

### Example 4: AOL's Free Trial CDs (1990s)

**The Tactic:**
Mail millions of CDs with "30 days free internet access."

**Weapons Used:**
- **Commitment (primary):** Installing software = commitment
- **Reciprocity:** Free trial = gift
- **Consistency:** After 30 days of use, canceling feels like loss

**The Results:**
- AOL went from 200,000 to 25 million subscribers
- 50% of US internet users in late 1990s

**Why It Works:**
- Installing = effortful commitment (not just clicking)
- 30 days = time to build habits
- By day 30, canceling means:
  - Losing email address
  - Losing chat contacts
  - Admitting trial was waste of time

**Lesson:** Free trials work because commitment builds over time.

---

### Example 5: Duolingo's Streak Feature

**The Tactic:**
Track consecutive days of use. Show "You're on a 47-day streak!"

**Weapons Used:**
- **Commitment (primary):** Each day adds to streak
- **Consistency:** Breaking streak violates commitment
- **Loss aversion (scarcity):** Losing streak feels terrible

**The Results:**
- Dramatically increased daily active users
- Users pay $7/month to "protect" streak
- One of highest-retention apps

**Why It Works:**
- Day 1 streak = easy to break
- Day 100 streak = would do almost anything to maintain
- Sunk cost increases with each day
- Breaking streak = admitting you failed

**Lesson:** Visible commitment tracking amplifies consistency pressure.

### Example 6: Charity's Foot-in-Door Technique

**The Tactic:**
Step 1: "Would you sign this petition for [cause]?" (Most people sign)
Step 2 (weeks later): "You signed the petition. Would you donate $20?"

**Weapons Used:**
- **Commitment (primary):** Signing = commitment to caring
- **Consistency:** Donating aligns with signing
- **Self-perception:** "I'm the kind of person who supports this cause"

**The Results:**
- 2-3X higher donation rate vs. direct ask
- Works for political campaigns, nonprofits, activism

**Why It Works:**
- Signing petition = public commitment
- Donation request feels consistent with that commitment
- Saying no to donation = inconsistent with signing

**Lesson:** Start with tiny yes, escalate to bigger yes.

---

## SOCIAL PROOF IN ACTION

### Example 7: Amazon's "Customers Who Bought X Also Bought Y"

**The Tactic:**
Show related products purchased by similar customers.

**Weapons Used:**
- **Social proof (primary):** Others like me made these choices
- **Authority:** Amazon's data knows what's relevant
- **Commitment:** Already decided to buy, might as well add more

**The Results:**

- Average order value increases 10-30%

**Why It Works:**

**The Results:**

### Example 9: Wikipedia's Donation Campaign

**The Tactic:**
"If everyone reading this gave $3, we'd be funded in an hour."

**Weapons Used:**

- **Reciprocity:** You've used Wikipedia for free
- **Scarcity:** Urgency in message

**The Results:**
- Raises $150M+ annually from donations
- 1% of readers donate (high for donation appeals)

**Why It Works:**
- Hypothetical social proof ("if everyone")
- Small ask ($3) reduces resistance
- Clear impact ("funded in an hour")
- Reciprocity built up over years of free use

**Lesson:** Implied social proof ("if everyone") can be as powerful as actual.

## AUTHORITY IN ACTION

### Example 10: White Coat Hypertension
