# Liking: The Friendly Thief

## We Say Yes to People We Like

Simple truth: **People prefer to say yes to those they know and like.**

Salespeople know this. That's why they spend the first 10 minutes building rapport. Con artists know this. That's why they're so charming.

The question isn't whether liking influences compliance. The question is: **What causes liking?**

Cialdini identified 6 factors:

## The Six Principles of Liking

### 1. Physical Attractiveness (The Halo Effect)

**Research:** Attractive people are perceived as:
- More intelligent
- More trustworthy
- More competent
- More successful

**The halo effect:** One positive trait (attractiveness) creates assumption of other positive traits.

**Study:** Attractive defendants receive lighter sentences (average 2X difference).

**Copywriting applications:**
- Professional headshots
- Polished design
- Beautiful product photography
- Attractive brand ambassadors

**Ethical consideration:** Yes, this is shallow. Yes, it works. No, you shouldn't rely on it exclusively.

---

### 2. Similarity (We Like People Like Us)

**Research:** We like people who:
- Share our opinions
- Have similar backgrounds
- Dress like us
- Share our interests

**Study:** People are more likely to help someone wearing the same college t-shirt (even if they don't know them).

**Applications:**
- Use "we" language
- Share common ground: "As a fellow [identity]..."
- Mirror customer language
- Shared enemy: "We both hate [problem]"

---

### 3. Compliments (Even Fake Ones Work)

**Research:** Compliments create liking even when:
- Obviously designed to gain favor
- Clearly untrue
- From strangers

**Why:** We want to believe compliments (confirmation bias).

**Applications:**
- Acknowledge customer intelligence: "You're probably already aware..."
- Validate their situation: "You've done great so far..."
- Appreciate their attention: "Thanks for being here"

**Warning:** Must feel genuine. Sarcasm or obvious flattery backfires.

---

### 4. Contact & Cooperation (Familiarity Breeds Liking)

**Research:** Repeated exposure increases liking (mere exposure effect).

**But:** Only if interactions are positive or neutral.

**Applications:**
- Consistent content (emails, social media)
- Show up regularly
- Be present in their world
- Cooperative framing: "Let's solve this together"

---

### 5. Conditioning & Association

**Principle:** We like things associated with positive experiences.

**Example:** Weather reporters get blamed for bad weather (even though they don't cause it).

**Applications:**
- Associate brand with positive emotions (joy, success, freedom)
- Use uplifting imagery
- Tell success stories
- Avoid negative associations

---

### 6. Good Cop / Bad Cop

**Mechanism:** After dealing with "bad cop," "good cop" seems likeable by contrast.

**Applications:**
- Address competitor's bad behavior, then offer better alternative
- Present harsh reality, then offer hopeful solution
- "I'm not like those other [category]..."

---

## 20+ Copywriting Applications

### APPLICATION 1: Conversational Tone

**Instead of:** "Our proprietary solution delivers optimal results."

**Use:** "Look, I get it. You've tried everything. Let me show you what actually works."

**Why:** We love hearing our own name.

---

### APPLICATION 17: Active Listening (Sales Calls)

**Mechanism:**
Let them talk. Repeat back what they said.

**Format:**
"If I'm understanding correctly, you're struggling with [X], right?"

"We're all trying to [achieve goal]. Let me show you what's worked for me."

**Why:** Cooperation > competition for building liking.

---

## Defense Strategies

### How to Protect Yourself

**1. Separate liking from merit**

Ask: "Would I buy this if I disliked the seller?"

If no, you're being influenced by liking, not product quality.

---

**2. Recognize rapport-building tactics**

Salespeople are trained to:
- Find common ground
- Mirror body language
- Compliment you
- Build friendship

**That's okay.** Just be aware it's happening.

---

**3. Notice when you like someone "too quickly"**

If you meet someone and immediately feel "We're so alike!" â†’ Be cautious.

They might be mirroring you intentionally.

---

**4. Don't let liking override judgment**

**Bad decision:** "I like this person, so I'll ignore red flags."

**Good decision:** "I like this person, but I'll still verify claims."

---

## Ethical Guidelines

### Rule 1: Be genuinely likeable

Don't fake personality. People sense inauthenticity.

### Rule 2: Find real common ground

Don't manufacture similarity. Find actual shared values/interests.

### Rule 3: Don't exploit friendship

If someone trusts you as a friend, don't abuse that trust to make a sale.

### Rule 4: Build liking through value

Best liking is earned through:
- Helping them
- Being consistent
- Showing up
- Delivering quality

### Rule 5: Respect boundaries

Liking doesn't mean they owe you anything. Don't guilt-trip.
