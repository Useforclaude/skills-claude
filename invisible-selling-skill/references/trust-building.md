# Trust-Building: Long-Term Relationship Strategies

## The Foundation of Invisible Selling

Trust is the currency of invisible selling. Without it, even the softest CTA feels pushy. With it, sales become natural conversations.

**The Trust Equation:**
People buy from those they:
- Know (familiarity)
- Like (connection)
- Trust (reliability)

Invisible selling focuses on building all three simultaneously.

## Why Trust Takes Time

### The Trust Timeline

**Week 1:** Awareness and initial impression
**Month 1:** Recognition and repeated exposure
**Month 3:** Familiarity and pattern recognition
**Month 6:** Trust foundation established
**Year 1:** Strong relationship formed
**Year 2+:** Deep loyalty and advocacy

**Key Insight:** You can't rush trust. But you can accelerate it through consistent value delivery and authentic engagement.

### The Compound Effect

Trust compounds like interest:
- Each positive interaction adds to the account
- Consistency multiplies the effect
- Time amplifies the impact
- One breach can erase years of deposits

**Strategy:** Make regular trust deposits through valuable, authentic interactions.

## Trust-Building Strategies

### 1. Consistent Value Delivery

**Principle:** Show up regularly with genuinely helpful content.

**Implementation:**

- Quality baseline (never publish below standard)
- Reliability (audience knows when to expect you)

**Content Types:**
- Educational tutorials
- Problem-solving guides
- Industry insights
- Personal experiences
- Actionable advice

**Example:**
Pat Flynn publishes podcast episodes every Friday without fail. His audience knows exactly when to expect value. This consistency builds trust.

**Trust Deposit:**
"This person shows up for me regularly. I can count on them."

### 2. Radical Transparency

### 7. Keeping Promises

**Principle:** Do exactly what you say you'll do, when you say you'll do it.

### 12. Patience with Timing
