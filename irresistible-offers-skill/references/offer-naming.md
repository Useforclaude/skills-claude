# Offer Naming - The Psychology of Names That Sell

**Your offer name is the first thing prospects see. Make it count.**

---

## Why Names Matter

### The Power of a Great Name

**A great name:**
- Captures attention immediately
- Evokes the desired outcome
- Positions your offer as premium
- Makes it memorable
- Creates desire before you even present
- Differentiates you from competitors

**A bad name:**
- Gets ignored
- Confuses people
- Commoditizes your offer
- Is instantly forgotten
- Requires extensive explanation
- Makes you seem generic

**Example:**
- Bad: "Marketing Course"
- Good: "The Client Attraction System"

**Same content, but the second name is 10x more compelling.**

### First Impression Science

**You have 3-5 seconds to capture attention.**

In those seconds, your offer name must:
1. Stop the scroll/turn the page
2. Create curiosity
3. Hint at the transformation
4. Sound valuable

**Your name is your first (and sometimes only) chance to make an impression.**

## Naming Psychology

### What Makes Names Compelling

**Psychological Triggers:**

**1. Specificity**
Specific names are more believable than vague ones.

- Vague: "Business Growth Program"
- Specific: "The 90-Day Path to $10K Months"

**2. Transformation**
Names that promise change are magnetic.

- Weak: "Fitness Program"
- Strong: "The Body Transformation Challenge"

**3. Exclusivity**
Names that imply selectivity are more desirable.

- Generic: "Business Group"
- Exclusive: "The Elite CEO Inner Circle"

**4. Speed**
Names that promise fast results create urgency.

- Slow: "Business Building Course"
- Fast: "The 30-Day Business Launch Sprint"

**5. Completeness**
Names that suggest "everything you need" reduce anxiety.

- Partial: "Marketing Tips"
- Complete: "The Complete Client Attraction System"

**6. Authority**
Names that sound authoritative build trust.

- Weak: "My Method"
- Strong: "The Proven 7-Figure Blueprint"
