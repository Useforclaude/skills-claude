# Risk Reversal & Guarantees

**How to remove all buying risk and make saying "yes" the only logical decision.**

---

## The Power of Risk Reversal

### What is Risk Reversal?

Risk reversal is the practice of taking on the risk that normally falls on the buyer and shouldering it yourself.

**Traditional Transaction:**
- Buyer pays money (risk: might not work)
- Seller gets money (no risk)
- Buyer assumes all risk

**Risk-Reversed Transaction:**
- Buyer pays money (but protected by guarantee)
- Seller guarantees outcome (takes on risk)
- Seller assumes all risk

### Why Risk Reversal Works

**The Psychology:**

**1. Fear is Stronger Than Desire**
People are more motivated to avoid loss than to achieve gain.

**2. Past Experiences**
Most have been burned before. They're naturally skeptical.

**3. Uncertainty**
"What if it doesn't work for ME?"

**4. Financial Risk**
"What if I waste my money?"

**5. Opportunity Cost**
"What if there's a better option?"

**Risk reversal addresses all of these fears.**

### The Buying Decision Formula

```
BUYING LIKELIHOOD = (Desire × Belief) ÷ Risk
```

**To increase purchases:**
- Increase desire (want it more) ✓
- Increase belief (trust it works) ✓
- **Decrease risk (guarantee) ← MASSIVE IMPACT**

**By removing risk, you can dramatically increase conversions.**

## Types of Guarantees

### 1. Money-Back Guarantee

**The Standard:**
"If you're not satisfied, we'll refund your money."

**Variations:**

**A. Unconditional Money-Back**
"100% money-back guarantee. No questions asked."

**Pros:**
- Removes all financial risk
- Shows extreme confidence
- Industry standard expectation

**Cons:**
- Some will take advantage
- Actual refund rate: typically 3-10%

**Example:**
"Try the program for 30 days. If you're not completely satisfied, email us and we'll refund 100% of your investment. No questions asked, no hoops to jump through."

**B. Conditional Money-Back**
"Complete the program and don't get results? Full refund."

**Pros:**
- Filters out non-serious buyers
- Ensures they do the work
- Lower refund rate

**Cons:**
- Slightly weaker than unconditional
- Need to verify completion

**Example:**
"Complete all 8 modules and implement the system. If you don't get at least 10 qualified leads, email us proof of completion and we'll refund 100%."

**C. Extended Money-Back**
"60-day, 90-day, or even 1-year guarantee"

**Pros:**
- More time = more comfort
- Shows extreme confidence
- Reduces urgency objection ("I need time to decide")

**Cons:**
- Longer uncertainty period for you
- Revenue isn't "safe" for longer

**Example:**
"You have a full 90 days to try everything. That's three entire months to see if this works for you. If at any point you're not satisfied, we'll refund every penny."

### 2. Performance Guarantee

**The Outcome Promise:**
"Get [specific result] or we'll [remedy]."

**Variations:**

**A. Results or Refund**
"Get X result or your money back."

**Example:**
"Lose 20+ pounds in 90 days or we'll refund 100%."

**B. Results or We Work Free**
"Get X result or we keep working until you do."

**Example:**
"Get 20 qualified leads per month or we'll continue coaching you for free until you do."

**C. Results or We Pay You**
"Get X result or we refund AND pay you extra."

**Example:**
"Add $50K in revenue in 6 months or we'll refund 100% AND pay you $1,000 for wasting your time."

**Pros:**
- Strongest guarantee possible
- Shows extreme confidence
- Makes buying decision obvious

**Cons:**
- You must be confident in your ability to deliver
- Need systems to track results
- More complex to administer

### 3. Satisfaction Guarantee

**The Feeling Promise:**
"Be happy or we'll make it right."

**Variations:**

"Love it or your money back."

**Example:**
"If you're not thrilled with the program, let us know and we'll refund you."

**B. Double-Your-Money-Back**
"Not satisfied? We'll double your refund."

**Example:**
"If you're not happy, we'll not only refund your $1,000—we'll give you $2,000."

**C. Keep Everything Refund**
"Not happy? Get refund and keep all materials."

**Example:**
"Even if you request a refund, keep all the courses, templates, and bonuses. They're yours forever."

**C. Success Insurance**
"If you don't succeed, we'll do it for you."

**Example:**
"If you implement our system and don't get clients, we'll personally help you close your first three deals."

**Pros:**
- Shows commitment to their success
- Doesn't require refund
- Aligns incentives perfectly

**Cons:**
- Ongoing time commitment
- Need clear boundaries
- Could be exploited

### 5. Price Guarantee

**The Cost Promise:**
"Price won't increase for you."

**Variations:**

**A. Price Lock**
"Lock in this price forever."

**Example:**
"Join today and lock in $997/month forever. Even when we raise prices to $1,997, you'll always pay $997."

**B. Best Price Guarantee**
"Lowest price you'll ever see."

**Example:**
"This is the lowest price this program will ever be offered at. It will never be cheaper than it is today."

**C. Price Match**
"Find it cheaper, we'll match it."

**Example:**
"If you find a comparable program cheaper, show us and we'll match the price."

**Pros:**
- Creates urgency to buy now
- Protects against future price increases
- Shows you won't undercut them

**Cons:**
- Locks you into pricing
- Hard to raise prices later
- Price match is risky if market changes

### 6. Hybrid/Stacked Guarantees

Get 20 leads in 30 days or full refund.

**Guarantee #2: 90-Day Money-Back**
Try everything for 90 days. Not happy? Full refund.

**Guarantee #3: Keep Everything**
Even if you refund, keep all bonuses and materials.

You literally can't lose."

**Why this works:**
- Multiple safety nets
- Overwhelming risk reversal
- Makes objection nearly impossible

## Crafting Your Perfect Guarantee

### Step 1: Understand Customer Fears

**What specifically worries them?**

**Common Fears:**
- "What if it doesn't work?"
- "What if I can't do it?"
- "What if I waste my money?"
- "What if it's too hard?"
- "What if I'm the exception?"
- "What if I've been scammed before?"

**Your guarantee should directly address their top 3 fears.**

### Step 2: Assess Your Confidence Level

**How confident are you in your ability to deliver?**

**Low Confidence (Getting Started):**
- Simple money-back guarantee
- 30-day trial period
- Basic satisfaction guarantee

**Medium Confidence (Proven Track Record):**
- 60-90 day guarantee
- Conditional results guarantee
- Enhanced money-back terms

**High Confidence (Highly Proven System):**
- Performance guarantee
- Extended timeframe
- Hybrid guarantees
- "Results or we work free"

**Only offer guarantees you can confidently fulfill.**

### Step 3: Choose Your Guarantee Type

**Based on:**
- Industry norms
- Your confidence level
- Customer fears
- Competitive landscape
- Your risk tolerance

**Questions:**
- What type addresses their fears best?
- What type shows your confidence?
- What type is uncommon in your industry?
- What type is sustainable for you?

### Step 4: Make It Specific

**Vague guarantees don't work:**

**Bad:** "Satisfaction guaranteed"
**Good:** "Lose 15+ lbs in 60 days or full refund"

**Bad:** "Money back if not happy"
**Good:** "Get 20 qualified leads in first 30 days or we refund 100% AND pay you $500 for wasting your time"

**Bad:** "We guarantee results"
**Good:** "Add $10K in revenue in 90 days or we'll work with you free until you do"

**Specificity = Believability**

### Step 5: Set Clear Terms

**Define:**

**Timeframe:**
When does guarantee apply?
"First 30 days" / "First 90 days" / "First year"

**Conditions:**
What must they do to qualify?
"Complete all modules" / "Implement the system" / "Attend all calls"

**Process:**
How do they claim it?
"Email us at support@..." / "Fill out this form" / "Schedule a call"

**Exclusions:**
What's NOT covered?
"Digital products can't be returned once accessed" (if applicable)

**Make terms clear and fair.**

### Step 6: Name Your Guarantee

**Give it a memorable name:**

**Examples:**
- "The 10K in 30 Days Guarantee"
- "The Wedding Dress Guarantee"
- "The No-Brainer Promise"
- "The Sleep-Well-Tonight Guarantee"
- "The We're-Not-Happy-Unless-You're-Happy Guarantee"
- "The Zero-Risk Guarantee"
- "The It-Works-Or-It's-Free Guarantee"

**Named guarantees are more memorable and powerful.**

## Advanced Guarantee Strategies

### The Conditional Guarantee

**Require action to qualify:**

**Example:**
"Complete all 6 modules and implement each step. If you do the work and don't get results, we'll refund 100% AND continue working with you free."

**Why this works:**
- Filters out non-doers
- Ensures they give it real effort
- Fair to you (they must try)
- Strong for them (protects if they do the work)

**Template:**
"Do [specific actions]. If you [do the work] and don't [get result], we'll [remedy]."

### The Upgrade Guarantee

**Offer to upgrade instead of refund:**

"Not getting results? Before we refund you, let us upgrade you to our VIP program at no extra cost."

**Why this works:**
- Saves the sale
- Shows commitment to their success
- Often solves the problem
- Reduces refunds

### The Time-Based Guarantee

**Different terms at different stages:**

**Example:**
"Days 1-30: 100% refund, no questions asked.
Days 31-60: Complete modules 1-3, then eligible for refund.
Days 61-90: Complete all modules, then eligible for refund."

**Why this works:**
- Easy refund early (builds trust)
- Requires effort later (filters non-doers)
- Fair at all stages

### The Success Insurance

**Guarantee they'll succeed:**

**Example:**
"We guarantee you'll get 10 clients in 90 days. If you don't, we'll personally work with you every day until you do—at no additional cost."

- Strongest possible guarantee
- Shows unlimited commitment
