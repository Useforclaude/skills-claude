# Stack Building - The Art of Presenting Maximum Value

**How to present your offer so the value is overwhelming and price becomes irrelevant.**

---

## What is Stack Building?

Stack building is the strategic presentation of everything included in your offer to maximize perceived value.

**The Core Idea:** When you list everything they get, assign individual values, and show the total—your price looks like an incredible bargain.

**Example:**
- Total Value: $27,000
- Your Price: $4,997
- Reaction: "How can I NOT buy this?"

---

## The Psychology of Stacking

### Why Stacking Works

**Psychological Principles at Play:**

**1. Anchoring Effect**
The first price (total value) becomes the anchor. Your actual price is compared against it.

**2. Loss Aversion**
People fear losing out on value more than they desire gaining it.

**3. Mental Accounting**
Each component is evaluated separately, then summed—making total seem huge.

**4. Reciprocity**
When you give so much, they feel compelled to reciprocate by buying.

**5. Overwhelm (Good Kind)**
So much value they can't process it all—default to "this must be good."

### The Perception Formula

```
PERCEIVED VALUE = Quantity × Quality × Presentation
```

**Quantity:** Number of components
**Quality:** Value of each component
**Presentation:** How you describe and frame it

**Master all three to maximize perceived value.**

## Naming Your Stack Components

### The Naming Formula

```
[Power Adjective/Phrase] + [What It Is] + (Specific Detail)
```

**Examples:**

**Boring → Exciting:**
- "Videos" → "The Complete Video Mastery Library (47 hours)"
- "Templates" → "The Ultimate Marketing Swipe File (187 Templates)"
- "Coaching" → "Weekly Winner's Circle Coaching Calls (12 months)"
- "Community" → "The Elite Entrepreneur's Inner Circle (Lifetime Access)"

### Power Words for Naming

**Adjectives:**
- Ultimate
- Complete
- Comprehensive
- Proven
- Exclusive
- Elite
- Premium
- Advanced
- Essential
- Revolutionary

**Nouns:**
- System
- Blueprint
- Framework
- Toolkit
- Arsenal
- Library
- Vault
- Accelerator
- Masterclass
- Intensive

**Examples:**
- The Ultimate Client Attraction System
- The Complete Sales Conversion Blueprint
- The Exclusive Entrepreneur's Toolkit
- The Proven 7-Figure Framework
- The Elite Scaling Accelerator

### Specificity in Naming

**Add specific numbers and details:**

**Generic:**
"Email templates"

**Specific:**
"52 Weekly Email Campaigns (One For Every Week, Pre-Written)"

**Generic:**
"Coaching calls"

**Specific:**
"24 Bi-Weekly Group Coaching Calls (60 Minutes Each, $200/Call Value)"

**Generic:**
"Video training"

**Specific:**
"The Complete Marketing Mastery Video Library (47 Hours Across 12 Modules)"

---

## Value Assignment Strategies

### How to Assign Dollar Values

**Method 1: Market Research**
What do others charge for similar?

**Example:**
- 1-on-1 coaching typically costs $200-500/hour
- Your 12 weekly calls = 12 hours
- Value: $2,400-6,000
- Conservative assignment: $3,000

**Method 2: Replacement Cost**
What would they pay to get this elsewhere?

**Example:**
- Hiring copywriter for sales page: $2,000-5,000
- You provide done-for-you sales page
- Value: $2,500 (mid-range)

**Method 3: Time Value**
Time to create × appropriate hourly rate

**Example:**
- Creating 52 email templates takes 20 hours
- Expert copywriter rate: $150/hour
- Value: $3,000

**Method 4: Result Value**
What's the result worth?

**Example:**
- If your system helps them get 20 clients
- Average client value: $2,000
- Total value generated: $40,000
- Your component value: $3,000 (conservative fraction)

### Value Assignment Principles

**Principle 1: Be Conservative**
Don't inflate—be honest and defensible.

**Principle 2: Be Consistent**
Similar items should have similar values.

**Principle 3: Be Market-Aware**
Know what competitors charge.

**Principle 4: Be Fair**
Could they actually get this for that price elsewhere?

**Principle 5: Round Numbers**
$1,500 not $1,487. $500 not $473.

### Value Calculation Template

**For Each Component:**

```
Component Name: _________________________
What It Is: _________________________
How It Helps: _________________________
Time to Create: _____ hours
Market Comparison: $_________
Replacement Cost: $_________
Result Value: $_________
ASSIGNED VALUE: $_________
```

```

### The Progressive Build

**Present components in strategic order:**

**Act 1: The Core (Foundation)**
Start with main training/program.
"First, you get the complete [Program Name]..."

**Act 2: The Amplifiers (Multiplication)**
Add tools and templates that multiply effectiveness.
"But that's not all. You also get..."

**Act 3: The Accelerators (Speed)**
Show done-for-you and support components.
"To make this even easier and faster..."

**Act 4: The Insurance (Risk Removal)**
Present ongoing support and community.
"Plus, you're never alone because..."

**Act 5: The Bonuses (Scarcity)**
Add time-sensitive bonuses.
"And if you join today, you also get..."

**Act 6: The Safety Net (Guarantee)**
Remove all risk.
"And you're completely protected by..."

**Act 7: The Reveal (Value vs Price)**
Show total value and your price.
"When you add it all up..."

### The Written Stack

**For Sales Pages:**

Use this format for maximum impact:

```
Here's Everything You Get When You Join [Program Name]:

✓ The Complete [Component Name]: [Brief description of benefit] ($X value)

✓ [Tool/Template Name]: [What it does for them] ($X value)

✓ Done-For-You [Service Name]: [What you do for them] ($X value)

✓ [Support Type]: [How it helps] ($X value)

✓ BONUS #1: [Name] - [Benefit] ($X value)

Total Value: $XX,XXX

You Save: $XX,XXX
```

**Opening:**
"Let me walk you through everything you're getting..."

**For Each Component:**
"You get [Component Name], which [benefit]. This alone is worth $X because [reason]."

**Progressive Totaling:**
"So far that's already $X in value..."

**Building Excitement:**
"But here's where it gets really exciting..."

**The Reveal:**
"When you add it all up, you're getting over $XX,XXX worth of training, tools, and support. If you bought each piece separately, you'd easily pay that much. But that's not what you're going to pay today..."

---

## Advanced Stacking Techniques

### The Bundle Strategy

**Create multiple stack options:**

**Option 1: Core Only** ($X)
Just the essential training.

**Option 2: Complete** ($XX) ⭐ MOST POPULAR
Training + tools + support + bonuses.

**Option 3: VIP** ($XXX)
Everything + done-for-you + private access.

**Psychology:**
- Middle option looks best (and most profit)
- Low option captures price-sensitive
- High option makes middle seem reasonable
- Most choose middle (where you want them)

### The Ascending Value Stack

**Start small, build to big:**

Component 1: $500
Component 2: $800
Component 3: $1,200
Component 4: $2,000
Component 5: $3,000
Bonus 1: $2,500
Bonus 2: $4,000

**Creates crescendo effect—value keeps getting bigger.**

### The Surprise Stack

**Reveal unexpected extras mid-way through:**

"You get A, B, and C... [pause]

But here's something I haven't mentioned yet that I think you'll love...

You ALSO get [Surprise Component]..."

**Creates delight and shows abundance.**

### The Social Proof Stack

**Integrate testimonials into your stack:**

"You get [Component Name]...

Here's what [Customer Name] said about just this one component:
'[Testimonial about that specific component]'

...and that's just one piece of what you're getting."

**Builds belief as you build value.**

### The Comparison Stack

**Compare each component to alternatives:**

"You get done-for-you sales page copywriting. If you hired a professional copywriter, you'd pay $2,500-5,000. We're including it free as part of your package."

**Makes your value clear and defensible.**

**Right:** Show individual values and total

**Fix:** Research and assign fair market values.

### Mistake #4: Weak Presentation

**Wrong:** Bullet list with no description
