## Core Principles

### The 4 U's Framework (Michael Masterson)

Every great headline should be:

1. **Useful** - Provides clear benefit
2. **Urgent** - Creates time pressure
3. **Unique** - Stands out from competitors
4. **Ultra-specific** - Uses numbers, details

**Example:**
❌ "Learn Marketing" (fails all 4)
✅ "Generate 500 Qualified Leads in 30 Days Using This 3-Step Framework" (hits all 4)

### Headline Length Optimization

**Optimal character count:** 40-70 characters
- Too short (<30): Not specific enough
- Too long (>100): Gets truncated, loses attention

**Optimal word count:** 6-12 words
- Sweet spot: 8-10 words
- Mobile: Aim for 6-8 words (fits one line)

### Emotional Triggers in Headlines

**High-Converting Emotions:**
1. **Curiosity** - "The Secret Behind..."
2. **Fear** - "5 Mistakes That..."
3. **Greed** - "Get 10X More..."
4. **Pride** - "Join Elite..."
5. **Belonging** - "For [Specific Group]..."
