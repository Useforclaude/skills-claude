## Case Study #1: Zappos - The Ultimate Customer Service Liking

### Background

**Founded:** 1999 (online shoe retailer)
**Acquired by:** Amazon ($1.2B, 2009)
**Core principle:** Exceptional customer service creates extreme liking

---

### The Liking Strategy

**Tactic #1: No Scripts (Human Connection)**

```
Traditional call centers:
- Agents follow scripts (robotic)
- Average handle time: 5-7 minutes (rush customers off)
- Metrics: Efficiency (calls per hour)

Zappos approach:
- NO SCRIPTS (agents empowered to be human)
- NO TIME LIMITS (record call: 10 hours 43 minutes!)
- Metrics: Customer happiness (not efficiency)

Example interaction:
Customer: "I need shoes for my wedding next week."
Zappos agent: Spent 2 hours discussing wedding, life, dreams—then found perfect shoes.

Result:
- Customer felt HEARD (not rushed)
- Human connection → Liking → Loyalty
```

---

**Tactic #2: Surprise Upgrades (Compliments via Actions)**

```
Standard practice:
- Customer orders standard shipping
- Gets standard shipping

Zappos practice:
- Customer orders standard shipping
- Zappos RANDOMLY upgrades to overnight (free)
- Customer surprised + delighted

Psychology:
- Unexpected generosity → Reciprocity + Liking
- "They didn't have to do that!" → Emotional bond

Frequency: 10-15% of orders randomly upgraded
Cost: ~$2M/year in shipping
ROI: Priceless word-of-mouth ($100M+ in earned media)
```

---

**Tactic #3: Handwritten Notes**

```
Implementation:
- Agents encouraged to send handwritten thank-you notes
- Personal touches (reference conversation details)
- Not automated (genuinely personal)

Example:
Customer mentioned their dog was sick during call.
Agent sent note: "Hope [Dog Name] is feeling better! -Sarah from Zappos"

Effect:
- Customer felt remembered (similarity: "they're dog lovers like me!")
- Human touch → Liking → Viral stories (customers share on social media)
```

---

**Tactic #4: Empowered Generosity**

```
Policy:
Agents empowered to:
- Issue refunds (no manager approval up to $500)
- Send flowers to customer in crisis
- Order pizza for customer if needed (yes, really)

Famous example:
Customer's mom died, couldn't return shoes in time.
Agent:
1. Processed return (no questions)
2. Sent flowers to customer
3. Called to offer condolences

Customer shared story online → 2M+ views → Massive brand love

Cost: $150 (flowers + shipping)
Value: Incalculable PR + loyalty
```

---

### Results

- Revenue: $0 (1999) → $1B+ (2008, pre-acquisition)

---

### Key Lessons

```

   - Time with customer = investment, not cost

2. Empower generosity
   - Trust employees to do right thing
   - Small costs (flowers, upgrades) = massive loyalty ROI

3. Surprise > Expected
   - Meet expectations = neutral
   - Exceed expectations = delight = liking

4. Personal touches matter
   - Handwritten notes
   - Remembering details
   - Treating customers as friends, not transactions

5. Liking = Word-of-mouth
   - Happy customers tell stories
   - Stories create more customers (free marketing)
```

## Case Study #2: Chewy - Pet Owner Similarity + Care

### Background

**Founded:** 2011 (online pet supplies)
**Acquired by:** PetSmart ($3.35B, 2017—largest e-commerce acquisition ever at the time)
**Core principle:** Similarity with pet owners + genuine care for pets

---

### The Liking Strategy

**Tactic #1: Pet-Centric Language (Similarity)**

```
Generic e-commerce:
"Your order has shipped"

Chewy:
"[Pet Name]'s food is on the way! 🐾"

Effect:
- Speaks to pet parents (identity: "I'm a pet parent, not just a customer")
- Similarity: "They understand that my pet is family"
- Liking: "They get me"
```

---

**Tactic #2: Pet Loss Condolences (Genuine Care)**

```
Process:
1. Customer cancels auto-ship (subscription)
2. AI flags "pet loss" keywords or customer mentions pet died
3. Customer service CALLS customer (not email—personal touch)
4. Offers condolences
5. Sends flowers or handwritten sympathy card
6. Processes refund for unopened food + TELLS CUSTOMER TO DONATE TO SHELTER (not return)

Example:
Customer posted on Twitter:
"My dog died. Chewy called to offer condolences, sent flowers, refunded food, and told me to donate it to a shelter. I'm crying. 😭"

Tweet: 250K+ likes, 40K retweets

Cost per interaction: $50-100 (flowers + food refund)
Value: Priceless brand love + viral word-of-mouth
```

---

**Tactic #3: Hand-Painted Pet Portraits**

```
Random surprise:
- Chewy artists hand-paint customer's pet (based on photo from account)
- Mail portrait to customer (unexpected)
- Happens randomly (~10,000/year)

Customer reaction:
- Total shock + delight
- Most share on social media (free marketing)
- Frame portrait (Chewy now in their home—daily reminder)

Example:
Twitter: "CHEWY SENT ME A PAINTING OF MY DOG?! I'M OBSESSED. 😭❤️"
Engagement: 500K+ impressions

Cost: ~$30-50 per portrait
Annual cost: $300K-500K
Value: $50M+ in earned media + brand love
```

---

**Tactic #4: Birthday Cards for Pets**

```
Implementation:
- Customer provides pet's birthday in profile
- Chewy sends birthday card (handwritten message) + coupon

Example card:
"Happy 5th Birthday, Max! 🎉
We hope your day is filled with treats and belly rubs!
- Your Friends at Chewy"

Effect:
- Similarity: "They remember my pet like family does!"
- Compliment: "They care about Max's birthday!"
- Liking → Loyalty
```

---

**Tactic #5: 24/7 Support with Pet Expertise**

```
Staff:
- All customer service reps are PET OWNERS (similarity)
- Many have vet tech backgrounds (expertise)
- Trained to give advice, not just process orders

Example interaction:
Customer: "My dog is scratching a lot. What food should I try?"
Generic response: "Here's a link to our food page."

Chewy response:
"I'm so sorry [Pet Name] is uncomfortable! My dog had the same issue. Let me ask—is the scratching seasonal or year-round? [5-minute conversation] Based on what you described, I'd recommend [specific food]. But I'd also suggest checking with your vet for allergies. Would you like me to send you some samples?"

Effect:
- Expertise + Genuine care → Trust → Liking
- Similarity: "They're pet owners too, they understand!"
```

---

### Results

```
Business metrics:
- Revenue: $0 (2011) → $3.5B (2017, acquisition) → $8.9B (2022)
- Customers: 20M+ active

Brand metrics:

- "Love Chewy": 78% of customers use word "love"
- Customers get Chewy tattoos (yes, really—dozens documented)
```

---

### Key Lessons

```
1. Know your customer's identity
   - Pet owners see pets as family (not property)
   - Speak to that identity ("pet parent")

2. Care about what customers care about
   - Customers care about pets → Care about pets too
   - Genuine care (not transactional) → Extreme liking

3. Surprise moments create viral stories
   - Pet portraits, condolences, birthday cards
   - Customers WANT to share (free marketing)

4. Hire for similarity

   - Shared experience → Better service → Liking

5. Small gestures = Big loyalty
   - $50 flower arrangement → Lifetime customer ($10,000 LTV)

```

## Case Study #3: Glossier - Community Cooperation + Similarity

### Background

**Founded:** 2014 (beauty brand)
**Founder:** Emily Weiss (former Into The Gloss blogger)
**Core principle:** Built BY customers, FOR customers (cooperation + similarity)

---

### The Liking Strategy

**Tactic #1: Community-Driven Product Development (Cooperation)**

```
Traditional beauty brands:
- Lab develops products
- Marketing sells products
- Customers buy (or don't)
- One-way process

Glossier:
1. Ask community: "What do you want?"
2. Develop based on feedback
3. Beta test with community
4. Launch with community input
5. Credit community

Example (Boy Brow product):
Into The Gloss blog (pre-Glossier) asked: "What's your holy grail brow product?"
Comments: "Nothing perfect exists!"
Emily: "Let's make it together."
→ Boy Brow developed WITH community feedback
→ Launch: Sold out in 24 hours

Effect:
- Community feels ownership: "I helped create this!"
- Cooperation → Extreme liking → Advocacy
```

---

**Tactic #2: Real People, Not Models (Similarity)**

```
Traditional beauty:
- Supermodels in ads (aspirational but unrelatable)
- Photoshop (unrealistic)
- Professional makeup artists (unattainable look)

Glossier:
- Real customers in ads (diverse ages, skin tones, body types)
- Minimal makeup ("skin first, makeup second")
- Natural lighting (not studio)
- NO PHOTOSHOP (authentic)

Example ad:
Photo: 32-year-old woman, freckles visible, natural lighting, minimal makeup
Copy: "Skin that looks like skin."

Similarity trigger:
Customer thinks: "She looks like ME! Not a supermodel. If it works for her..."

Result:
- Relatability → Trust → Purchase
- Instagram: Customers post selfies (UGC) because they see selves represented
```

---

**Tactic #3: User-Generated Content (UGC) Strategy**

```
Campaign: #GlossierPink

Glossier encourages:
- Customers post selfies wearing products
- Tag #GlossierPink or #Glossier
- Glossier reposts (free exposure for customers)

Effect:
1. Cooperation: Customers create content FOR brand
2. Compliment: Glossier celebrates customers (reposts = recognition)
3. Public commitment: Posting selfie = endorsement
4. Similarity: Potential customers see "people like me"

Results:
- Instagram followers: 2.7M (mostly organic)
- UGC posts: 500K+ with #Glossier
- Customer acquisition cost: 70% lower than industry (UGC = free marketing)
```

---

**Tactic #4: Showroom-as-Community Hub**

```
Traditional retail:
- Store = transactional (buy and leave)
- Sales associates push products

Glossier showrooms:
- No sales pressure (associates called "editors," not salespeople)
- Try everything (testers everywhere)
- Take selfies (Instagram-worthy spaces, pink walls, mirrors)
- Hang out (couches, social space)
- Free stickers (branded merch, customers voluntarily display)

Effect:
- Feels like friend's apartment (similarity), not store
- Community gathering space (cooperation)
- Customers spend 60+ minutes (vs 10-15 in typical store)
- Liking → Purchase (but not pushy)

Result:
- Store conversion: 40% (vs 15-20% traditional retail)
- Social posts from stores: 100K+/year (free marketing)
```

---

**Tactic #5: Founder Accessibility**

```
Emily Weiss (CEO):
- Responds to DMs/comments (not PR team—actually her)
- Shares customer posts on personal Instagram
- Writes blog posts (personal stories, vulnerable, relatable)
- Hosts community events (meets customers in person)

Example:
Customer DM: "I love Boy Brow but wish it came in [shade]"
Emily: "We're working on it! Thank you for the feedback. ❤️"
→ Shade launched 6 months later
→ Customer tagged in launch post: "This is for you!"

Effect:
- Cooperation: "The CEO listens to ME!"
- Similarity: "She's relatable, not corporate"
- Liking: Personal connection → Loyalty
```

---

### Results

```
Business metrics:
- Revenue: $0 (2014) → $100M (2017) → $1.8B valuation (2019)
- CAC: $20-30 (vs $50-100 industry average) [70% lower due to UGC]
- Repeat purchase rate: 48% (vs 15-25% beauty industry)

Brand metrics:
- Instagram: 2.7M followers (90% organic growth)
- UGC: 500K+ customer posts
- Media: "Cult beauty brand," "Community-driven beauty"

Liking metrics:

- "Love Glossier": 71% of customers use word "love"
- Customers tattoo logo (dozens documented)
- Fan communities: Reddit r/glossier 50K+ members (unprompted)
```

---

### Key Lessons

```
1. Build WITH customers, not FOR them
   - Co-creation → Ownership → Loyalty
   - "I helped make this!" = Extreme commitment

2. Representation = Similarity = Trust
   - Show real customers (diverse, relatable)
   - "She looks like me" → "It'll work for me"

3. User-generated content is gold
   - Customers create better marketing than ads
   - Authentic, trusted, FREE

4. Make customers the heroes
   - Repost their content (recognition)
   - Credit their ideas (compliments)
   - Liking → Advocacy

5. Founder accessibility = Connection
   - Personal relationship with brand
   - Not faceless corporation → Liking
```

## Case Study #4: Tesla - Founder-Customer Connection

### Background

**Founded:** 2003
**CEO:** Elon Musk (2008-present)
**Core principle:** Direct relationship between founder and customers (no middlemen)

---

### The Liking Strategy

**Tactic #1: Elon's Twitter Accessibility**

```
Traditional CEO:
- PR team filters all communications
- Corporate speak
- Distant, inaccessible

Elon Musk:
- Responds to thousands of customer tweets PERSONALLY
- No filter (speaks his mind, for better or worse)
- Implements customer suggestions (publicly credits them)

Example (2018):
Customer tweet: "@elonmusk Any chance of adding fart sounds to Tesla cars?"
Elon: "Absolutely."
→ "Emissions Testing Mode" added in next update (fart sounds)
→ Customer credited

Effect:
- Cooperation: "Elon listens to me!"
- Compliment: "My idea was implemented!"
- Liking: Personal connection to CEO → Brand loyalty
```

---

**Tactic #2: No Traditional Advertising (Word-of-Mouth Only)**

```
Traditional auto:
- Billions spent on TV ads
- Celebrity endorsements
- Dealerships (middlemen)

Tesla:
- $0 advertising spend
- No dealerships (direct sales)
- Relies 100% on customer word-of-mouth

Why this works:
- Customers feel special (not advertised masses)
- Liking → Advocacy (customers voluntarily promote)
- Trust: Friend's recommendation > Ad

Result:
- 40% of Tesla sales from referrals (vs 5-10% auto industry)
- Customers create YouTube reviews (unprompted, millions of views)
- Forums: 500K+ Tesla owners discussing/defending brand
```

---

**Tactic #3: Referral Program (Cooperation + Rewards)**

```
Program:
- Refer friend → Both get benefits
- Benefits: Free Supercharging, exclusive wheels, chance to win new car
- Top referrers get invited to special events (meet Elon, factory tours)

Psychological triggers:
- Reciprocity: Friend gets benefit (helping, not selling)
- Cooperation: Both win (shared benefit)
- Recognition: Top referrers publicly celebrated
- Exclusivity: Special events (status)

Result:
- 100K+ referrals in first year
- Top referrer: 188 sales (unpaid!)
- Customers compete to refer (gamification)
```

---

**Tactic #4: Over-the-Air Updates (Constant Improvement)**

```
Traditional cars:
- Buy car → Car stays same (or depreciates in capability)
- Need new features → Buy new car

Tesla:
- Buy car → Car improves over time (software updates)
- New features added (free): Autopilot improvements, games, acceleration boosts, etc.

Example:
Customer tweets: "Wish my Tesla had [feature]"
Elon: "Will add in next update"
→ Feature ships 2 weeks later

Psychology:
- Cooperation: "They're improving my car based on MY feedback"
- Compliment: "They value my input"
- Liking: "Tesla keeps getting better" → Sunk cost (invested, less likely to switch)

Result:
- Retention: 91% (highest in auto industry vs 60% average)
- Customers feel car is "future-proof"
```

---

**Tactic #5: Mission Alignment (Shared Values)**

```
Tesla's stated mission:
"Accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy"

Target customer values:
- Environmental sustainability (clean energy)
- Innovation (future-forward)
- Disruption (challenge status quo)

Similarity:
- Customer: "I care about climate change"
- Tesla: "We're fighting climate change"
- Match → Liking

Effect:
- Buying Tesla = identity statement ("I'm helping the planet")
- Values alignment → Loyalty
- Customers defend Tesla online (shared mission)

Result:
- Owners become advocates (not just customers)
- Cult-like loyalty (Tesla meetups, clubs, online forums)
```

### The Liking Strategy

**Tactic #1: Employees Encouraged to Chat (Not Just Transact)**

```
Traditional grocery:
- Employees: "Did you find everything?" (scripted)
- Goal: Fast checkout (efficiency)
- Metrics: Items scanned per minute

Trader Joe's:
- Employees: Encouraged to CHAT (genuine conversation)
- Topics: Food, recipes, life, anything
- Goal: Human connection (not just efficiency)

→ 5-minute conversation about cooking

Effect:

- Liking → Loyalty
```

---

**Tactic #2: Employees Taste Everything (Expertise + Similarity)**

```
Policy:
- Employees MUST taste all products (paid to do so)

```

---

**Tactic #4: Product Discontinuation (Cooperation via Transparency)**

```

- Employees TELL customers why
- Accept feedback ("We hear you!")

Example:
Customer: "Where's [Product]?"
Employee: "Unfortunately, we discontinued it—not enough people buying. But a lot of customers miss it! Let me write your feedback for our buyers."

vs. Other stores:
"We don't carry that." [End of conversation]

Effect:
- Transparency → Trust
- Cooperation: "They listen to feedback!"
- Liking: Honest communication

Sometimes: Products return based on feedback (cooperation validated)
```

---

**Tactic #5: Fearless Flyer (Quirky Newsletter)**

```
Format:
- Hand-drawn illustrations (not stock photos)
- Witty, conversational copy (not corporate)
- Honest product descriptions ("This is weird, but try it!")

Effect:
