```

---

3. Customer service CALLS customer (not email‚Äîpersonal touch)
4. Offers condolences
5. Sends flowers or handwritten sympathy card
6. Processes refund for unopened food + TELLS CUSTOMER TO DONATE TO SHELTER (not return)

### Background

**Founded:** 2014 (beauty brand)
**Founder:** Emily Weiss (former Into The Gloss blogger)
**Core principle:** Built BY customers, FOR customers (cooperation + similarity)

---

### The Liking Strategy

**Tactic #1: Community-Driven Product Development (Cooperation)**

```
Traditional beauty brands:
- Lab develops products
- Marketing sells products
- Customers buy (or don't)
- One-way process

Glossier:
1. Ask community: "What do you want?"
2. Develop based on feedback

Into The Gloss blog (pre-Glossier) asked: "What's your holy grail brow product?"
Comments: "Nothing perfect exists!"
Emily: "Let's make it together."
‚Üí Boy Brow developed WITH community feedback
‚Üí Launch: Sold out in 24 hours

Effect:
- Community feels ownership: "I helped create this!"
- Cooperation ‚Üí Extreme liking ‚Üí Advocacy
```

---

**Tactic #2: Real People, Not Models (Similarity)**

```
Traditional beauty:

- Photoshop (unrealistic)
- Professional makeup artists (unattainable look)

Glossier:
- Real customers in ads (diverse ages, skin tones, body types)
- Minimal makeup ("skin first, makeup second")
- Natural lighting (not studio)
- NO PHOTOSHOP (authentic)

Example ad:
Photo: 32-year-old woman, freckles visible, natural lighting, minimal makeup
Copy: "Skin that looks like skin."

Similarity trigger:
Customer thinks: "She looks like ME! Not a supermodel. If it works for her..."

Result:
- Relatability ‚Üí Trust ‚Üí Purchase
- Instagram: Customers post selfies (UGC) because they see selves represented
```

- Customer acquisition cost: 70% lower than industry (UGC = free marketing)
```

---

**Tactic #4: Showroom-as-Community Hub**

```
Traditional retail:
- Store = transactional (buy and leave)
- Sales associates push products

Glossier showrooms:
- No sales pressure (associates called "editors," not salespeople)
- Try everything (testers everywhere)
- Take selfies (Instagram-worthy spaces, pink walls, mirrors)
- Hang out (couches, social space)
- Free stickers (branded merch, customers voluntarily display)

Effect:
- Feels like friend's apartment (similarity), not store
- Community gathering space (cooperation)
- Customers spend 60+ minutes (vs 10-15 in typical store)
- Liking ‚Üí Purchase (but not pushy)

```
Emily Weiss (CEO):
- Responds to DMs/comments (not PR team‚Äîactually her)
- Shares customer posts on personal Instagram
- Writes blog posts (personal stories, vulnerable, relatable)
- Hosts community events (meets customers in person)

Example:
Customer DM: "I love Boy Brow but wish it came in [shade]"
Emily: "We're working on it! Thank you for the feedback. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
‚Üí Shade launched 6 months later
‚Üí Customer tagged in launch post: "This is for you!"
