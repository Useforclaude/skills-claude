## Campaign #1: Dove "Real Beauty" (2004-Present)

### Strategy: Similarity Through Representation

**Challenge:**
Beauty industry dominated by unattainable standards (thin, young, photoshopped models).

**Target:**
Women tired of feeling inadequate; desire authentic representation.

**Campaign Elements:**

**Phase 1: "Real Beauty" Print Ads (2004)**
```
Concept:
- Replace models with real women (diverse ages, sizes, ethnicities)
- No Photoshop (authentic bodies, wrinkles, cellulite shown)
- Headline: "Real women have curves"

Similarity trigger:
Customer thinks: "That woman looks like me! Not a supermodel—a real person."

Initial results (2004-2005):

- Brand recall: +32%
- Social media: Viral before social media existed (offline word-of-mouth)
```

---

**Phase 2: "Evolution" Video (2006)**
```
Concept:
- 60-second timelapse showing model transformation
- Makeup, hair, lighting, Photoshop = unrecognizable
- Tagline: "No wonder our perception of beauty is distorted"

Psychology:
- Exposes beauty industry manipulation
- Shared enemy: Unrealistic standards
- Dove = ally, not perpetrator

Results:
- Views: 114M+ (organic, pre-YouTube virality)
- Earned media: $150M+ (news coverage, talk shows)
- Brand favorability: +41% among women 25-55
```

---

**Phase 3: "Real Beauty Sketches" (2013)**
```
Concept:
- Forensic artist draws women based on:
  1. Their self-description (usually negative)
  2. Stranger's description (usually positive)
- Reveal: Stranger's sketch is more beautiful
- Message: "You are more beautiful than you think"

Similarity + Compliment:
- Similarity: Real women (relatable)
- Compliment: "You're beautiful" (boosts self-esteem)

Results:
- Views: 180M+ in 1 month (most-watched ad of 2013)
- Shares: 4.6M (organic)
- Brand love: +52% (women felt Dove "gets them")
- Sales: $5B+ sustained growth
```

---

**Phase 4: "Show Us" Campaign (2019-Present)**
```
Concept:
- Stock photo library of REAL women (no stereotypes)
- 5,000+ images, free for anyone to use
- Goal: Change media representation of women

Cooperation:
- Dove + customers + media work together to change industry
- Shared goal: End stereotypical female imagery

Results:
- Images downloaded: 1M+ times

```

---

### Why It Worked:

**Similarity:**

- Diverse representation = Everyone sees themselves

**Shared values:**
- Anti-Photoshop = Authenticity (customers value this)
- Body positivity = Acceptance (customers desire this)

**Cooperation:**

- "We're fighting this together"

**Result:**

## Campaign #2: Apple "Get a Mac" (2006-2009)

### Strategy: Similarity Through Identity Contrast

**Challenge:**
Macs had 2% market share (2004); seen as niche, expensive.

**Target:**
Creative professionals, young people, early adopters (who see themselves as different from corporate types).

**Campaign Elements:**

**Characters:**
```
MAC (played by Justin Long):
- Casual (hoodie, jeans)
- Cool, confident, relaxed
- Young (20s-30s)
- Creative, innovative

PC (played by John Hodgman):
- Formal (suit and tie)
- Nerdy, awkward, stressed
- Middle-aged (40s-50s)
- Corporate, boring
```

**Similarity trigger:**

```
Target audience (young creatives) thinks:
"I'm NOT that boring PC guy. I'm the cool Mac guy!"

Identity alignment:
- If you're creative → You're a Mac
- If you're innovative → You're a Mac
- If you're young → You're a Mac
- If you're boring/corporate → You're a PC (insult!)
```

**65 commercials, all following same formula:**

```
Mac: "Hi, I'm a Mac."
PC: "And I'm a PC."
[PC has problem (virus, crash, complexity)]
[Mac doesn't have problem (just works)]
Tagline: "Get a Mac."
```

**Example: "Virus" (2006)**
```
PC: [sneezing, coughing] "I think I have a virus"
Mac: "You look terrible!"
PC: "114,000 viruses for PCs. How many for Macs?"
Mac: "Zero."
PC: [sneezes on Mac]
Mac: "I'm fine. I don't get PC viruses."

Message: PCs = sick, Macs = healthy
Similarity: "I don't want to be sick like PC guy. I'm healthy like Mac!"
```

---

### Results (2006-2009):

```
Market share:
- 2004: 2.3% (pre-campaign)
- 2006: 4.8% (+109%)
- 2009: 9.6% (+317% from 2004)

Brand perception (2006 vs 2009):
- "Cool" factor: +89%
- "Innovative": +76%
- "For creative people": +82%
- "User-friendly": +68%

Customer loyalty:
- Mac users: 89% would buy Mac again (cult-like)
- PC users: 48% would buy PC again

Revenue:
- Mac sales: $7B (2006) → $24B (2009) +243%
```

---

### Why It Worked:

**Identity similarity:**
- "I'm creative like Mac, not boring like PC"
- Self-perception validation

**Contrast:**
- Made PC users feel inferior (controversial but effective)
- Mac users felt superior (reinforced decision)

**Humor:**
- Likeable characters (even PC guy was endearing)
- Made ads watchable, shareable

**Consistency:**
- 65 ads, same format = mere exposure effect
- Brand identity reinforced over and over

**Result:**
> **Buying a Mac became an identity statement: "I'm the kind of person who uses a Mac."**

## Campaign #3: Patagonia "Don't Buy This Jacket" (2011)

### Strategy: Value Similarity (Anti-Consumerism)

**Challenge:**
Black Friday = peak consumerism; goes against Patagonia's environmental values.

**Target:**
Environmentally conscious consumers who value sustainability over consumption.

**Campaign:**

**Full-page ad in NYT (Black Friday 2011):**
```
Headline: "DON'T BUY THIS JACKET"

Body copy:
"This jacket (Patagonia R2) requires 135 liters of water to produce.
It generates 20 pounds of CO2.
2/3 of its materials are not recyclable.

So before you buy this jacket, consider:
- Do you really need it?
- Can you repair your old one instead?
- Can you borrow one?

We make the best outdoor gear. But our best is still harmful to the planet.

If you buy one, we ask that you:
- Repair it when it breaks (we'll help for free)
- Reuse it when you're done
- Recycle it when it's truly dead

Better yet: Don't buy it unless you truly need it.

This is against our short-term business interests.
But it's right for the planet.

- Patagonia"
```

---

### Psychological Triggers:

**Value similarity:**
```
Patagonia's values:
- Environment > profit
- Quality > quantity
- Repair > replace
- Long-term > short-term

Target customer's values:
- [EXACT SAME] ✅

Customer thinks: "This brand shares my values. They're like me. I trust them."
```

**Reverse psychology:**
```
"Don't buy" → Makes you want to buy MORE
Why? Because it proves Patagonia ISN'T just after your money.
Trust → Purchase intent
```

**Cooperation:**
```
Patagonia + customer vs. mindless consumerism
Shared enemy: Environmental destruction
Shared goal: Protect planet

"We're in this together."
```

---

### Results:

```
Immediate (Black Friday 2011):
- Sales: +30% (despite "don't buy" message!)
- Website traffic: +300%
- Media coverage: $10M+ earned media

Long-term (2011-2020):
- Revenue: $540M (2011) → $1B+ (2020) +85%

- Brand love: NPS +72 (exceptional)

"Worn Wear" program (launched after campaign):
- Buy back used Patagonia gear
- Repair for free (lifetime guarantee)

- Participation: 500K+ customers

Environmental impact:
- Customers kept products 2.3x longer (vs industry average)
- Repair requests: +400% (2011-2020)
- Customer base: Shifted to values-aligned buyers (higher LTV)
```

---

### Why It Worked:

**Authenticity:**
- Patagonia actually MEANS it (not greenwashing)
- Customers can verify (Worn Wear program exists, repairs are free)
- Trust established

**Values alignment:**
- Perfect similarity with target customer values
- "They're fighting for what I believe in"

**Differentiation:**
- No other brand would run this ad
- Patagonia = unique, authentic, trustworthy

**Result:**
> **Customers became evangelists. "I don't just buy Patagonia—I believe in them."**

- Trust scores: +38%

```

**Shared identity:**
- "I'm a traveler who values authenticity" = Airbnb customer
- Identity alignment

**Cooperation:**
- Host + guest work together for great experience
