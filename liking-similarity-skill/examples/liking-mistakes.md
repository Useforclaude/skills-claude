> **Building liking takes years. Destroying it takes minutes.**

---

## Mistake #1: Fake Similarity (Inauthentic Pandering)

### What It Is

Pretending to share values, identity, or characteristics you don't actually have.

---

### Example #1: Pepsi's Kendall Jenner Ad (2017)

**The mistake:**

```
Ad concept:
- Protest march (imitating Black Lives Matter/social justice movements)
- Kendall Jenner (wealthy, privileged model) joins protest
- Hands Pepsi to police officer
- Everyone happy, problem solved

Intended message:
"Pepsi brings people together / We're part of social movements"

Actual message:
"We're trivializing serious social issues to sell soda"

Similarity attempt:
- Target: Young activists who care about social justice
- Pepsi positioning: "We care about social justice too!"

Why it failed:
❌ Inauthentic (Pepsi doesn't actually fight for social justice)
❌ Trivializes real struggles (protests aren't about soda)
❌ Kendall Jenner ≠ Similar to protesters (wealthy, privileged, not activist)
❌ Tone-deaf (police brutality isn't solved with Pepsi)
```

**Backlash:**

```
Social media: Instant outrage
- "This is the worst ad ever made"
- "Pepsi trivializes BLM"
- Saturday Night Live parody (brutal)

Result:
- Ad pulled within 24 hours
- Apology issued
- Brand damage: Incalculable
- Pepsi became joke for years
```

---

### Why Fake Similarity Backfires

```
Psychology:
1. Customers detect inauthenticity (we're hardwired for it)
2. Feels manipulative → Anger
3. Broken trust → Lasting damage
4. Similarity must be REAL to work

Formula for disaster:
Fake similarity + Social issue = Massive backlash
```

---

### How to Avoid

```
✅ DO:
- Only claim similarity if it's TRUE
- If you care about a cause, PROVE IT with actions (not just ads)
- Research deeply before entering sensitive topics
- Test with focus groups (would have caught Pepsi mistake)

❌ DON'T:
- Pretend to care about causes for marketing
- Use social movements as backdrops for ads
- Assume similarity without authenticity
```

---

### Example #2: H&M "Coolest Monkey in the Jungle" Hoodie (2018)

**The mistake:**

```
Product: Kids' hoodie with text "Coolest Monkey in the Jungle"
Model: Young Black child

What H&M thought:
"Cute kids' clothing line"

What customers saw:
Racist imagery (Black child + "monkey" = historical racist trope)

Similarity mistake:
H&M (Swedish company, mostly white leadership) didn't understand racial context in US/UK markets.
```

**Result:**

```
- Global outrage
- Boycotts
- Store vandalism (South Africa protests)
- Celebrity partnerships ended (The Weeknd dropped H&M)
- Stock drop
- Years of brand damage
```

**Why it failed:**
❌ Lack of diversity in decision-making (no one caught it)
❌ Cultural insensitivity
❌ Assumed similarity with customers without understanding their lived experience

**Lesson:**
> **Similarity requires UNDERSTANDING the customer's perspective, not assuming.**

---

## Mistake #2: Insincere Compliments (Obvious Flattery)

### What It Is

Generic, excessive, or obviously fake compliments that insult customer intelligence.

---

### Example: Generic Post-Purchase Emails

**Bad example:**

```
Subject: "You're Amazing!"

Body:
"Hey [Name],

You're amazing! You're incredible! You're a superstar!

Thanks for your order of [Product].

You're the best customer ever!

❤️ [Brand]"
```

**Why it backfires:**

```
❌ Generic (says this to EVERYONE)
❌ Excessive (insults intelligence)
❌ No specificity (what did customer do that's "amazing"?)
❌ Feels manipulative (obvious flattery)

Customer thinks: "They're just saying this. It means nothing."

Result: Ignored (or worse, annoyance)
```

---

### Research: When Compliments Backfire

**Study: Compliment Overload (Vonk, 2002)**

```
Setup:
- Participants receive compliments (few vs. many)
- Measure liking of complimenter

Results:
1-3 compliments:
- Liking: 7.8/10

4-6 compliments:
- Liking: 5.2/10 (-33%) ⚠️

7+ compliments:
- Liking: 3.1/10 (-60%) 🚨

Conclusion: Too many compliments = Suspicious → Disliking
```

---

### How to Avoid

```
✅ DO:
- Make compliments SPECIFIC
  "Great choice on [specific product/feature]" (tied to action)
- Use sparingly (1-2 per interaction, not 10)
- Base on actual behavior
  "You completed setup fast—clearly tech-savvy!"

❌ DON'T:
- Generic praise ("You're amazing!" for doing nothing)
- Excessive flattery (feels manipulative)
- Unearned compliments (customer did nothing special)
```

---

### Good Example:

```
Subject: "Smart choice 👍"

Body:
"Hey [Name],

You picked [Product Feature X]—most people miss that option.

Clearly you did your research. That feature will save you [specific benefit].

Enjoy!

- [Brand]"
```

**Why it works:**
✅ Specific (references actual choice)
✅ Compliments intelligence (tied to action)
✅ Explains WHY it's smart (validates decision)
✅ Not over-the-top (one genuine compliment)

---

## Mistake #3: Forced Cooperation (Manipulation, Not Collaboration)

### What It Is

Making customers "participate" in ways that benefit brand but not customer.

---

### Example #1: American Apparel "Hurricane Sandy Sale" (2012)

**The mistake:**

```
Context: Hurricane Sandy devastated East Coast (deaths, destruction)

American Apparel email:
"In case you're bored during the storm, shop our sale! 20% off with code SANDYSALE"

Intended: Cooperation ("We're helping you pass time")

Actual: Exploiting tragedy for profit

Customer reaction:
"People are dying and you're trying to sell clothes?!"

Result:
- Massive backlash
- Brand seen as heartless
- Apology issued (but damage done)
```

**Why it failed:**
❌ Not cooperation (exploitation)
❌ No shared goal (brand profits, customers suffer)
❌ Tone-deaf timing
❌ Insensitive (disaster ≠ sales opportunity)

---

### Example #2: Gap "Loot Our Stores" Tweet (2011)

**The mistake:**

```
Context: London riots (looting, violence)

Gap tweet:
"Stay safe during the riots. If you need something warm, stores are open."

Implied: "Come loot our stores (but buy, not steal)"

Intended (maybe?): Helpfulness?

Customer reaction:
"Are you joking? This is disgusting."

Result:
- Tweet deleted
- Apology
- Brand seen as insensitive
```

**Why it failed:**
❌ Exploiting crisis
❌ Tone-deaf (riots aren't shopping opportunities)
❌ Not cooperation (brand profits from tragedy)

---

### How to Avoid

```
✅ DO (Real Cooperation):
- Shared goals (both brand + customer benefit)
- Voluntary participation (customer chooses)
- Genuine help (not disguised selling)
- Appropriate timing (not during crises)

❌ DON'T:
- Exploit tragedies for sales
- Force participation (guilt, pressure)
- Pretend selling is "cooperation"
- Use disasters as marketing opportunities
```

---

### Good Example: Patagonia Repair Program

```
Cooperation:
- Shared goal: Reduce environmental impact
- Patagonia: Repairs products for free (costs them money)
- Customer: Keeps product longer (saves money)
- Planet: Less waste

Result:
- Both win (genuine cooperation)
- Customer loyalty skyrockets
- No manipulation (authentic)
```

---

## Mistake #4: Similarity Overreach (Trying Too Hard)

### What It Is

Attempting similarity so aggressively it feels fake or cringeworthy.

---

### Example: Brands Using Teen Slang Incorrectly

**Bad examples:**

```
Brand tweet (from Fortune 500 company):
"Our new product is totally lit fam! 🔥 No cap, it slaps! Periodt!"

Customer (Gen Z) reaction:
"Cringe. Delete this."

Why it failed:
❌ Trying too hard (forced similarity)
❌ Inauthentic (corporate trying to be Gen Z)
❌ Incorrect usage (misusing slang = worse than not using it)
❌ Age mismatch (65-year-old CEO saying "no cap" = awkward)
```

---

### Example: Hillary Clinton "Pokémon GO to the polls" (2016)

**The mistake:**

```
Context: 2016 presidential campaign, Pokémon GO was popular

Hillary Clinton quote:
"I don't know who created Pokémon GO, but I'm trying to figure out how we get them to have Pokémon GO to the polls!"

Intended: Similarity with young voters (who played Pokémon GO)

Result:
- Became meme (for being cringeworthy)
- "Hello fellow kids" energy (trying too hard)
- Didn't resonate with young voters

Why it failed:
❌ Forced reference (awkward pun)
❌ Out of touch (older person trying to relate via meme)
❌ Not authentic (clearly scripted)
```

---

### How to Avoid

```
✅ DO:
- Use similarity naturally (not forced)
- If unsure about slang/references, DON'T use them
- Hire people from target demo (authenticity)
- Be yourself (authentic is better than fake similarity)

❌ DON'T:
- Force trendy references if it's not natural
- Try to "relate" by using slang incorrectly
- Pretend to be younger/different than you are
- "Hello fellow kids" energy
```

---

### Good Example: Wendy's Twitter

```
Approach:
- Hired Gen Z social media manager
- Authentic voice (not corporate trying to be Gen Z—actual Gen Z person)
- Uses slang correctly (native speaker)
- Playful, but doesn't try too hard

Result:
- 3.9M followers
- Viral tweets regularly
- Feels authentic (because it IS)
```

**Lesson:**
> **Don't fake similarity. Either be similar (hire similar people) or don't claim it.**

---

## Mistake #5: Attractiveness Fails (Offensive or Inappropriate Imagery)

### What It Is

Using imagery that backfires (offensive, inappropriate, or misguided).

---

### Example #1: Protein World "Beach Body Ready" Campaign (2015)

**The mistake:**

```
Ad:
- Image: Extremely thin model in bikini
- Text: "Are you beach body ready?"

Implied message:
"You need to look like this to be 'beach body ready'"

Result:
- Petition: 70,000+ signatures to remove ads
- Vandalism: Ads defaced across London
- Backlash: "All bodies are beach body ready"

Why it failed:
❌ Body shaming (implied most women aren't "ready")
❌ Unrealistic beauty standard
❌ Offensive to customers (made them feel bad)
❌ Opposite of similarity (model ≠ most customers)
```

---

### Example #2: Dove Body Wash Ad (2017)

**The mistake:**

```
Ad sequence (GIF):
1. Black woman in brown shirt
2. Removes shirt (uses Dove body wash)
3. Becomes white woman in light shirt

Implied message (unintentional):
"Dove washes you whiter"

Result:
- Viral outrage
- Accusations of racism
- Apology issued
- Massive brand damage (ironic for Dove, known for "Real Beauty" inclusivity)

Why it failed:
❌ Offensive racial implications (even if unintentional)
❌ Lack of diverse review (no one caught it)
❌ Contradicted brand values (Dove = inclusivity)
```

---

### How to Avoid

```
✅ DO:
- Test imagery with diverse focus groups
- Ask: "Could this be interpreted offensively?"
- Diverse creative team (catch blind spots)
- Show realistic, relatable people (similarity)
- Inclusive beauty standards (all body types, races, ages)

❌ DON'T:
- Use only one body type (excludes customers)
- Imply people need to change to be acceptable
- Make assumptions about what's "attractive"
- Skip diversity reviews
```

---

## Mistake #6: Ignoring Customer Feedback (Broken Cooperation)

### What It Is

Asking for customer input, then ignoring it.

---

### Example: Gap Logo Redesign (2010)

**The mistake:**

```
Process:
1. Gap unveiled new logo (without customer input)
2. Customers hated it (outcry on social media)
3. Gap: "We'll crowdsource a new design!" (fake cooperation)
4. Customers submitted designs
5. Gap ignored submissions, reverted to original logo

Result:
- Customers felt deceived (fake cooperation)
- Trust broken
- Wasted effort (customers invested time)
- Gap looked incompetent

Why it failed:
❌ Fake cooperation (asked for input, didn't use it)
❌ Broken promise (said "we'll crowdsource," didn't)
❌ Wasted customer time (disrespectful)
```

---

### How to Avoid

```
✅ DO:
- Only ask for input if you'll ACTUALLY use it
- If you implement suggestions, CREDIT customers
- If you can't implement, explain WHY
- Follow through on promises

❌ DON'T:
- Ask for feedback as PR stunt (then ignore it)
- Make customers work for nothing
- Break promises about cooperation
```

---

## Mistake #7: Over-Familiarity (Assuming Closeness)

### What It Is

Acting too familiar too soon (like you're best friends when you just met).

---

### Example: Overly Casual First Emails

**Bad example:**

```
Subject: "Heyyyy bestie! 💕"

Body:
"OMG hiiiiii [Name]!!!

We're SO EXCITED you're here!! You're basically family now! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Let's hang out! (JK, but seriously, use our product!)

XOXO,
[Brand]"
```

**Why it backfires:**

```
❌ Too familiar (we just met)
❌ Forced intimacy (uncomfortable)
❌ Insincere (not actually friends)
❌ Cringeworthy (excessive enthusiasm)

Customer thinks: "Uh, who are you? We don't know each other."

Result: Unsubscribe or ignore
```

---

### How to Avoid

```
✅ DO:
- Start professional, warm up gradually
- Match customer's tone (if they're casual, be casual)
- Earn familiarity over time (not immediate)
- Be friendly, not fake-best-friends

Example progression:
Email 1 (day 0): Professional, welcoming
Email 10 (day 30): Friendly, warmer
Email 50 (day 180): Familiar (earned relationship)
```

---

## Mistake #8: Complimenting the Wrong Thing

### What It Is

Complimenting aspects customers didn't choose or can't control.

---

### Example: Appearance Compliments in Professional Settings

**Bad example:**

```
SaaS company email:
"Hey [Name], you look great in your profile photo! 😍"

Why it's wrong:
❌ Unprofessional (appearance irrelevant to product)
❌ Uncomfortable (especially if gendered)
❌ Wrong focus (compliment choices, not appearance)
```

---

### How to Avoid

```
✅ DO compliment:
- Choices (product selection, customization)
- Actions (completed onboarding, consistency)
- Intelligence (smart use of features)
- Achievements (milestones, goals reached)
- Taste (aesthetic choices they made)

❌ DON'T compliment:
- Physical appearance (professional settings)
- Things they can't control (genetics)
- Personal attributes unrelated to product
```

---

## Mistake #9: Fake Scarcity/Urgency (Broken Trust)

### What It Is

Using false scarcity to pressure customers.

---

### Example: Fake Countdown Timers

**The mistake:**

```
Website: "Only 3 left! Order now!"
Customer orders, timer resets.
Next visitor: "Only 3 left!" (same message)

Or:

"Sale ends in 10 minutes!" (countdown timer)
Timer hits 0:00...
Timer resets: "Sale extended! Ends in 10 minutes!" (infinite loop)

Result:
- Customer discovers it's fake (Reddit threads expose these)
- Trust destroyed
- Brand seen as manipulative
- Similarity broken (we value honesty, they lied)
```

---

### How to Avoid

```
✅ DO:
- Only use scarcity if it's REAL
- If extending sale, be honest: "We're extending the sale due to demand"
- Build trust, not pressure

❌ DON'T:
- Fake scarcity (customers will discover it)
- Manipulative countdown timers that reset
- Lie about stock levels
```

---

## Mistake #10: Ignoring Negative Feedback (Defensiveness)

### What It Is

Responding defensively to criticism instead of with empathy.

---

### Example: Amy's Baking Company (Kitchen Nightmares, 2013)

**The mistake:**

```
Context:
- Restaurant featured on Gordon Ramsay's show
- Owners were combative, rude to customers
- Episode aired, social media backlash

Response from owners:
- Argued with EVERY negative comment
- Called customers "haters"
- Threatened legal action
- Blamed Gordon Ramsay
- Refused to take any responsibility

Result:
- Restaurant became internet meme (for being worst ever)
- Business failed
- Owners became cautionary tale
```

**Why it failed:**
❌ Defensive (no cooperation)
❌ Blamed customers (no empathy)
❌ Refused to improve (no growth)
❌ Hostile (destroyed any liking)

---

### How to Avoid

```
✅ DO:
- Respond with empathy: "We hear you. We're sorry."
- Take responsibility: "This is on us."
- Offer solution: "Here's how we'll fix it."
- Learn: "Your feedback helps us improve."

❌ DON'T:
- Argue with customers publicly
- Blame customers for problems
- Get defensive
- Ignore criticism
```

---

## Mistake #11: Cultural Insensitivity (Lack of Research)

### What It Is

Entering new markets without understanding local culture.

---

### Example: Dolce & Gabbana China Ad (2018)

**The mistake:**

```
Ad:
- Chinese model struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks
- Voiceover: Condescending tone

Intended: Playful contrast (Italian food meets Chinese culture)

Actual: Offensive stereotypes (Chinese people can't eat properly)

Result:
- Massive backlash in China
- Boycotts
- Fashion show canceled
- $1B+ in lost sales (China was huge market)
- Designers' leaked racist texts made it worse

Why it failed:
❌ Stereotyping (offensive)
❌ Condescending (not similarity, superiority)
❌ Lack of cultural research
❌ No diverse input in creative process
```

---

### How to Avoid

```
✅ DO:
- Hire local teams (cultural expertise)
- Test campaigns with local focus groups
- Research cultural sensitivities deeply
- When in doubt, ask locals

❌ DON'T:
- Assume what works in one culture works everywhere
- Use stereotypes (even "playful" ones)
- Skip cultural research
- Ignore warning signs from local teams
```

---

## Recovery Strategies

### If You Make a Liking Mistake:

**Step 1: Acknowledge Immediately**
```
"We made a mistake. We hear you."
(Within 24 hours—don't let it fester)
```

**Step 2: Apologize Sincerely**
```
"We're genuinely sorry. This doesn't reflect our values."
(No excuses, no "sorry if you were offended")
```

**Step 3: Explain What Went Wrong**
```
"Here's what happened and why it happened."
(Transparency, not defensiveness)
```

**Step 4: Commit to Change**
```
"Here's what we're doing to prevent this:
- [Specific action 1]
- [Specific action 2]
- [Specific action 3]"
```

**Step 5: Follow Through**
```
Actually implement changes.
Report back on progress.
Prove you learned.
```

---

### Example: KFC Chicken Shortage Apology (UK, 2018)

**The mistake:**
KFC ran out of chicken (supply chain failure). Stores closed.

**The recovery:**

```
Ad:
- Rearranged KFC buckets to spell "FCK"
- "FCK, we're sorry."
- Full-page newspaper ad
- Humorous, self-deprecating
- Transparent about what went wrong
- Promised fix

Result:
- Viral (in a good way)
- Customers forgave them
- Brand love INCREASED (authenticity + humor)
- Turned disaster into PR win
```

**Why it worked:**
✅ Fast response (within days)
✅ Humor (self-deprecating, not defensive)
✅ Transparency (explained problem)
✅ Authenticity (genuine apology)

---

## Conclusion: The Cost of Liking Mistakes

**Average impact of major liking mistakes:**

```
Brand trust: -30 to -70% (takes years to rebuild)
Sales: -10 to -50% (immediate impact)
Stock price: -5 to -20% (if public)
Social sentiment: Flip from positive to negative overnight
Recovery time: 6 months to 5+ years (sometimes permanent damage)

Examples:
- Pepsi Kendall ad: Brand damage lasting 3+ years
- United "passenger dragging" (2017): Stock dropped $1.4B in one day
- Dove racist ad: Set back years of Real Beauty positioning
- Amy's Baking Company: Never recovered (closed)
```

**Takeaway:**
> **One mistake can undo years of liking-building. Prevent, don't recover.**

---

**The 3 Rules to Avoid Liking Mistakes:**

```
1. ✅ Be AUTHENTIC
   Don't fake similarity, values, or care.

2. ✅ TEST EVERYTHING
   Diverse focus groups catch mistakes before launch.

3. ✅ WHEN IN DOUBT, DON'T
   If something feels risky, it probably is. Skip it.
```

**Remember:**
> **Liking is fragile. Build carefully. Protect fiercely.**

*End of Liking Mistakes*
