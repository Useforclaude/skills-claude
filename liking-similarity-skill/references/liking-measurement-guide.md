## Introduction: Making Liking Measurable

**The challenge:**
"Liking" feels soft, subjective, unmeasurable.

**The truth:**
Liking is HIGHLY measurable—and predicts revenue, retention, and growth.

**This guide covers:**
1. Core liking metrics
2. Survey methodologies
3. Behavioral indicators
4. Benchmarks
5. Tracking systems

---

## Part 1: Core Liking Metrics

### Metric #1: Net Promoter Score (NPS)

**What it measures:** Overall liking and loyalty

**Question:**
"How likely are you to recommend [Brand] to a friend or colleague?"
(0-10 scale)

**Calculation:**

```
Promoters: 9-10 (love the brand)
Passives: 7-8 (neutral)
Detractors: 0-6 (dislike)

NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors

Example:
100 responses:
- 60 promoters (9-10): 60%
- 25 passives (7-8): 25%
- 15 detractors (0-6): 15%

NPS = 60% - 15% = +45
```

**Benchmarks:**

```
World-class: 70+  (Tesla: +96, Chewy: +86)
Excellent:   50-70
Good:        30-50
Average:     0-30
Poor:        < 0
```

**Why it matters:**
NPS = Proxy for liking. High NPS = Customers like you enough to recommend.

---

### Metric #2: Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)

**What it measures:** Immediate satisfaction with interaction/product

**Question:**
"How satisfied are you with [Brand/Product/Experience]?"
(1-5 scale)

**Calculation:**

```
Average all responses:

Example:
100 responses:
- 5 stars: 50
- 4 stars: 30
- 3 stars: 15
- 2 stars: 3
- 1 star: 2

CSAT = (5×50 + 4×30 + 3×15 + 2×3 + 1×2) / 100 = 4.21 / 5
```

**Benchmarks:**

```
World-class: 4.7+ / 5
Excellent:   4.3-4.7
Good:        4.0-4.3
Average:     3.5-4.0
Poor:        < 3.5
```

**Why it matters:**
CSAT = Short-term happiness. High CSAT = Customers like most interactions.

---

### Metric #3: Brand Affinity Score (BAS)

**What it measures:** Emotional connection to brand

**Questions (1-7 Likert scale):**

```
1. "I feel connected to [Brand]"
2. "I trust [Brand]"
3. "I'd miss [Brand] if it disappeared"
4. "I recommend [Brand] to friends"
5. "[Brand] shares my values"
6. "I identify with [Brand]"
7. "I love [Brand]"
```

**Calculation:**

```
Average all 7 questions:

Example (1 customer):
Q1: 6/7
Q2: 7/7
Q3: 5/7
Q4: 6/7
Q5: 7/7
Q6: 5/7
Q7: 6/7

BAS = (6 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 5 + 6) / 7 = 6.0 / 7 = 85.7/100
```

**Benchmarks:**

```
High liking:    5.5+ / 7  (78%+)
Moderate:       4.0-5.5   (57-78%)
Low liking:     < 4.0     (<57%)
```

**Why it matters:**
BAS = Deep emotional connection. High BAS = Customers truly LIKE your brand (not just satisfied).

---

### Metric #4: Referral Rate

**What it measures:** Willingness to help brand grow (behavioral liking)

**Calculation:**

```
Referral Rate = (Customers who referred / Total customers) × 100

Example:
10,000 customers
1,200 made referrals

Referral Rate = (1,200 / 10,000) × 100 = 12%
```

**Benchmarks:**

```
Excellent:  40%+  (extreme liking—Zappos, Chewy level)
Good:       25-40%
Average:    10-25%
Poor:       < 10%
```

**Why it matters:**
Referrals = Ultimate proof of liking. People only refer brands they genuinely like.

---

### Metric #5: Retention Rate

**What it measures:** Customers staying over time (behavioral loyalty)

**Calculation:**

```
90-Day Retention = (Customers active at Day 90 / Total customers) × 100

Example:
1,000 customers signed up Jan 1
750 still active Apr 1 (90 days later)

Retention = (750 / 1,000) × 100 = 75%
```

**Benchmarks (90-day):**

```
SaaS:
- Excellent: 70-90%
- Good: 60-70%
- Average: 40-60%
- Poor: < 40%

E-commerce:
- Excellent: 35-50%
- Good: 25-35%
- Average: 15-25%
- Poor: < 15%

Subscription:
- Excellent: 85-95%
- Good: 75-85%
- Average: 60-75%
- Poor: < 60%
```

**Why it matters:**
Retention = Behavioral proof of liking. Customers stay when they like the brand.

---

### Metric #6: Social Sentiment

**What it measures:** Public perception (qualitative liking)

**Methodology:**

```
1. Collect mentions (social media, reviews, forums)
2. Classify sentiment:
   - Positive (praise, love, recommendation)
   - Neutral (factual, no emotion)
   - Negative (criticism, complaints, hate)

3. Calculate:
   Positive Sentiment % = (Positive mentions / Total mentions) × 100
```

**Tools:**
- Brandwatch
- Sprout Social
- Hootsuite Insights
- Manual review (100 recent mentions)

**Benchmarks:**

```
Excellent:  85%+ positive
Good:       70-85%
Average:    50-70%
Poor:       < 50%
```

**Why it matters:**
Social sentiment = Public liking. What customers say publicly reflects true feelings.

## Part 2: Behavioral Indicators of Liking

### Indicator #1: Time Spent

```
Hypothesis: People spend time with what they like.

- Daily active users: >50% of user base
- Return rate: >60% come back within 7 days
```

---

### Indicator #2: Voluntary Brand Engagement

```
Hypothesis: People voluntarily engage with brands they like.

Measure:

- Wear branded merch (unpaid promotion)

High liking indicators:
- Social follow rate: >15% of customers
- Community participation: >20% of customers
- Event attendance: >30% of invited customers
- Merch requests: Customers ASK for merch (ultimate liking)
```

---

### Indicator #3: Unprompted Sharing

- Competitor comparison rate (how often they shop around)

High liking indicators:
- Churn from competitor offer: <5%
- Price premium tolerance: +10-20% vs competitors

- What's not? (fix or cut)
- New initiatives to test
- Set goals for next quarter

Week 4: Implement
- Launch new initiatives
- Communicate goals to team
- Track progress
```

---

## Part 6: Advanced Analysis

### Cohort Analysis: High vs. Low Liking

```
Segment customers by Overall Liking Score:

High Liking (70-100):
- NPS: ____
- Retention: ____
- LTV: $____
- Referrals: ____

Low Liking (0-40):
- NPS: ____
- Retention: ____
- LTV: $____
- Referrals: ____

Calculate difference:
High liking = __x better retention
High liking = __x higher LTV
High liking = __x more referrals

ROI of liking:
1-point increase in Liking Score = $____ increase in LTV
```

**Example:**

```
High Liking (80+):
- Retention: 87%
- LTV: $1,680
- Referrals: 48%

Low Liking (<40):
- Retention: 38%
- LTV: $420
- Referrals: 8%

Difference:
- 2.3x retention
- 4.0x LTV
- 6.0x referrals

Insight: Increasing average Liking Score by 10 points = +$300 LTV per customer
```
