```

---

### Targeting Approaches

```
One product for everyone
Example: Coca-Cola (original strategy)
```

**2. Differentiated (Multi-segment):**
```
Different products for different segments
Example: Apple (iPhone SE, iPhone Pro)
```

**3. Concentrated (Niche):**

Focus on one segment
Example: Tesla (initially luxury electric cars)
```

## 📍 Positioning

### Positioning Statement Template

```
For [Target Audience]
who [Statement of Need/Opportunity],
[Product Name] is a [Product Category]
that [Statement of Key Benefit].

Unlike [Primary Competitive Alternative],
[Product Name] [Statement of Primary Differentiation].
```

**Example: Slack**
```
For teams
who need to communicate effectively,
Slack is a messaging platform
that organizes conversations by topic.

Unlike email,
Slack makes it easy to find information and stay in sync.
```

---

### Positioning Map

```
Price
  ↑
  │  Premium       Luxury
  │  [Whole Foods] [Erewhon]
  │
  │  Value         Standard
  │  [Trader Joe's][Safeway]
  │
  └────────────────────────→ Quality
   Low             High
```

**Strategy: Find white space (unmet need)**

---

### Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

**Formula:**
```
We're the only [Category] that [Unique Benefit] for [Target Audience]
```

**Examples:**

**FedEx:**
```
"When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight"
→ USP: Speed + Reliability
```

**Domino's (original):**
```
"Fresh, hot pizza delivered in 30 minutes or less, or it's free"
→ USP: Speed + Guarantee
```

**Dollar Shave Club:**
```
"Shave time. Shave money."
→ USP: Convenience + Value
```

## ⚔️ Competitive Strategy

### Porter's Five Forces

```
1. COMPETITIVE RIVALRY
   How many competitors? How intense?
   High rivalry → Price wars, lower profits

2. THREAT OF NEW ENTRANTS
   How easy to enter market?
   Low barriers → More competition

3. BARGAINING POWER OF SUPPLIERS
   How many suppliers? How critical?
   Few suppliers → They control prices

4. BARGAINING POWER OF BUYERS
   How price-sensitive? Switching costs?
   Many alternatives → Buyers have power

5. THREAT OF SUBSTITUTES
   Alternative solutions?
   Many substitutes → Limit pricing power
```

**Example: Uber**
```
Rivalry:           HIGH (Lyft, taxis)
New Entrants:      MEDIUM (tech required, regulations)
Supplier Power:    LOW (many drivers)
Buyer Power:       HIGH (easy to switch apps)
Substitutes:       MEDIUM (public transit, owned cars)

Strategy: Differentiate through technology & network effects
```

Strengths:  Better price than A, better features than B

```

---

### Competitive Positioning

**Blue Ocean Strategy:**
```
Red Ocean (Compete in existing market)
- Fight for share
- Beat competition
- Exploit existing demand

Blue Ocean (Create new market)
- Create uncontested space
- Make competition irrelevant
- Create new demand

Example: Cirque du Soleil

        → No animal acts, sophisticated shows
        → Higher prices, adult audience
```

## 📈 Measurement & Analytics

### Key Metrics by Stage

**Awareness:**
```
- Traffic (visits, unique visitors)
- Impressions
- Reach
- Brand mentions
```

**Consideration:**
```
- Engagement (time on site, pages/session)
- Email signups
- Content downloads
- Webinar attendees
```

**Conversion:**
```
- Conversion rate
- Cost per acquisition (CPA)
- Lead-to-customer rate

```

**Retention:**

---

### Marketing ROI

**Formula:**
```
ROI = (Revenue - Marketing Cost) / Marketing Cost × 100%

Example:
Revenue from campaign:   $100,000
Marketing spend:         $25,000
ROI = ($100K - $25K) / $25K × 100% = 300%

For every $1 spent, earned $4 back.
```

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
```
CAC = Total Marketing + Sales Cost / New Customers

Example:
Marketing: $20,000/month
Sales:     $10,000/month
New customers: 100

CAC = $30,000 / 100 = $300 per customer
```

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**
```
LTV:CAC > 3:1 = Good
LTV:CAC < 3:1 = Unsustainable

Example:
LTV = $1,500
CAC = $300
Ratio = 5:1 (Excellent!)
```
