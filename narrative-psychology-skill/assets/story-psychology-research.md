## Research Gaps and Future Directions

### Areas Needing More Research

**1. Cross-Cultural Validation**
- Most research: Western samples (WEIRD: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic)
- Need: Replication in diverse cultures
- Question: Are narrative mechanisms universal or culturally specific?

**2. New Media Narratives**
- VR/AR storytelling
- Interactive narratives (games)
- AI-generated stories
- Question: Do emerging formats activate brain differently?

**3. Long-Term Effects**
- Most studies: Immediate or short-term effects
- Need: Longitudinal studies tracking narrative impact over years
- Question: Do childhood stories shape adult identity permanently?

**4. Therapeutic Mechanisms**
- Narrative therapy effective, but mechanism unclear
- Need: Process research identifying active ingredients
- Question: What specific narrative changes predict therapeutic benefit?

**5. Individual Differences**
- Personality moderates narrative effects
- Need: Better understanding of who responds to what stories
- Question: Can we match narratives to individuals for maximum impact?

**6. Ethical Implications**
- Narrative persuasion can bypass critical thinking
- Need: Ethical frameworks for narrative use
