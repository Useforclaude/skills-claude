# Narrative Identity: The Stories We Tell Ourselves

## Overview

Narrative Identity Theory posits that humans construct their sense of self through the stories they tell about their lives. We don't just have identities—we ARE stories. This comprehensive reference explores how personal narratives shape who we are, how we behave, and how we find meaning.

**Key Theorist:** Dan McAdams (Northwestern University, 1985-present)

## Core Theory

### What is Narrative Identity?

**Definition (McAdams, 2001):**
"An internalized and evolving story of the self that incorporates the reconstructed past, perceived present, and anticipated future into a coherent life narrative that provides unity and purpose."

**Key Components:**

#### 1. Internalized
- Not just public story told to others
- Internal mental representation
- How we understand ourselves privately

#### 2. Evolving
- Not fixed autobiography
- Constantly revised based on new experiences
- Reconstruction, not recording

#### 3. Incorporates Time
- **Past:** Reconstructed memories (not objective facts)
- **Present:** Current self-understanding
- **Future:** Imagined trajectory

#### 4. Coherent
- Holds together as a story
- Makes sense as a whole
- Cause-effect connections

#### 5. Provides Unity
- Integrates diverse experiences into single self
- "I am one person despite changes over time"

#### 6. Provides Purpose
- Answers "Why am I here?"
- Gives meaning to existence
- Directs future behavior

### Why Narratives?

**Question:** Why do humans construct identity as story rather than, say, list of traits?

**McAdams' Answer:**

#### 1. Time-Binding
**Problem:** Humans experience time—past, present, future
**Solution:** Stories inherently temporal—they unfold over time
**Result:** Narrative is natural format for temporal beings

#### 2. Meaning-Making
**Problem:** Need to make sense of complex, chaotic experiences
**Solution:** Stories create order, causation, themes
**Result:** Random events become meaningful plot

#### 3. Social Communication
**Problem:** Must explain ourselves to others
**Solution:** Stories are shared cultural form
**Result:** Can communicate complex identity efficiently

#### 4. Goal-Directed Action
**Problem:** Humans are agentic—we act with intentions
**Solution:** Stories have characters with motivations and goals
**Result:** Narrative frame for understanding our own agency

#### 5. Cultural Embeddedness
**Problem:** Identity shaped by culture
**Solution:** Stories are cultural artifacts; we internalize cultural narratives
**Result:** Individual identity connected to collective identity

### Levels of Personality (McAdams, 1995)

**Three Levels of Knowing a Person:**

#### Level 1: Dispositional Traits
**What:** Broad, stable characteristics
**Examples:** Big Five (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)
**Question Answered:** "What is this person like?"

#### Level 2: Characteristic Adaptations
**What:** Goals, values, coping strategies, developmental concerns
**Examples:** "I'm working toward becoming a doctor," "I value honesty above all"
**Question Answered:** "What does this person want and how do they pursue it?"

#### Level 3: Narrative Identity
**What:** Integrated life story
**Examples:** "I overcame poverty through education and now help others do the same"
**Question Answered:** "Who is this person? How did they become who they are?"

**Hierarchy:**
- Level 1: Universal (everyone has traits)
- Level 2: Contextualized (goals within life situation)
- Level 3: Individualized (unique life story)

**Full Understanding:**
Requires all three levels—traits, goals, AND story

## The Life Story Interview

### McAdams' Life Story Interview Protocol

**Purpose:** Elicit narrative identity systematically

**Duration:** 1-2 hours

**Setting:** Private, comfortable, recorded

### Eight Key Scenes

**Instructions:** "Think of your life as a book with chapters. Describe specific scenes that stand out as especially important."

#### 1. Peak Experience
**Prompt:** "Describe a high point—one of the best moments in your life"

**Analysis:**
- What themes emerge? (Achievement, love, belonging, spirituality)
- Emotional tone
- Agency vs. communion

**Example:**
"Graduating college—my parents' faces in the crowd. First in my family to graduate. I felt proud but also responsible to honor their sacrifice."

**Theme:** Achievement + Communion (family connection)

#### 2. Nadir Experience
**Prompt:** "Describe a low point—one of the worst moments"

**Analysis:**
- How is suffering interpreted?
- Redemption vs. contamination sequence
- Sources of strength or weakness

**Example:**
"My father's death when I was 16. Devastated. But his last words to me—'Make me proud'—became my motivation."

**Sequence:** Contamination → Redemption

#### 3. Turning Point
**Prompt:** "Describe an episode where you changed direction in your life"

**Analysis:**
- What caused the turn?
- Active (I chose) vs. passive (it happened to me)
- Before/after contrast

**Example:**
"Failed my first semester of college. Rock bottom. Realized I had to ask for help. Found a tutor, joined study groups. Transformed my approach to learning."

**Agency:** High (active change)

#### 4. Earliest Memory
**Prompt:** "What is the earliest memory you have?"

**Analysis:**
- Often symbolic (not necessarily first event, but first remembered)
- Themes foreshadowing life story
- Emotional tone

**Example:**
"Maybe age 3—my mother crying in the kitchen. I tried to hug her. She pushed me away. I felt... useless."

**Theme:** Helplessness, desire to comfort others (potential origin of caregiving identity)

#### 5. Important Childhood Scene (Age 3-12)
**Prompt:** "Describe a memory from childhood that stands out"

#### 6. Important Adolescent Scene (Age 13-17)
**Prompt:** "Describe a memory from your teen years"

#### 7. Important Adult Scene (Age 18+)
**Prompt:** "Describe an important memory from adulthood"

#### 8. Other Important Scene
**Prompt:** "Any other scene that's important to your life story"

### Additional Interview Components

#### Life Chapters
**Prompt:** "Think of your life as a book with chapters. What are the main chapters? Give each a title."

**Analysis:**
- How is life segmented?
- Chapter transitions = Key events
- Chapter themes

**Example:**
- Chapter 1: "Innocent Years" (Childhood)
- Chapter 2: "Loss" (Father's death)
- Chapter 3: "Finding Myself" (College)
- Chapter 4: "Building" (Career, family)

#### Challenge
**Prompt:** "Looking back, what has been the greatest challenge in your life? How have you dealt with it?"

#### Influence
**Prompt:** "Who has been the most important influence in your life? How?"

#### Future Script
**Prompt:** "Imagine your future. What do you see for the next chapters?"

**Analysis:**
- Optimistic vs. pessimistic projection
- Continuity vs. change expected
- Goals and fears

#### Personal Ideology
**Prompt:** "What are your core values and beliefs? How have they developed?"

#### Life Theme
**Prompt:** "Looking at your life as a whole, what would you say is the central theme?"

**Examples:**
- "Overcoming adversity"
- "Helping others"
- "Quest for knowledge"
- "Building family legacy"

### Coding the Life Story

## Narrative Structures: Redemption vs. Contamination

### The Redemptive Self (McAdams, 2006)

**Redemption Narrative:** Bad is transformed into good

**Structure:** Suffering → Growth

**Examples:**
- "I was bullied as a child, but it made me empathetic to others' pain. Now I'm a counselor."
- "Cancer was terrifying, but it taught me what really matters. I'm grateful for that clarity."
- "Losing my job forced me to pursue my true passion. Best thing that ever happened."

#### Components of Redemption Narratives

**1. Early Advantage or Blessing**
- "I was lucky to have loving parents"
- Sense of being special or chosen
- Sets expectation for positive life

**2. Awareness of Others' Suffering**
- "I saw people less fortunate"
- Develops empathy
- Sense of responsibility

**3. Moral Steadfastness**
- "I've always tried to do the right thing"
- Core values remain constant
- Integrity despite challenges

**4. Redemption Sequences**
- Negative events reinterpreted as ultimately positive
- "Everything happens for a reason"
- Growth from adversity

**5. Prosocial Goals**
- "I want to give back"
- Generativity (concern for next generation)
- Legacy of helping others

#### Cultural Context: The American Narrative

**McAdams' Observation:**
Redemption narratives extremely common in American life stories

**Why?**
- **American Dream:** Rags to riches
- **Protestant Work Ethic:** Suffering builds character
- **Individualism:** Personal transformation possible
- **Optimism:** Things get better

**Cultural Narrative:**
"Anyone can overcome adversity and succeed through hard work and moral living"

**Result:** Americans internalize redemption as expected life story structure

### Contamination Narratives

**Contamination Narrative:** Good is transformed into bad

**Structure:** Happiness → Ruin

**Examples:**
- "I had a happy childhood, but then my father left and everything fell apart. Nothing's been good since."
- "I finally got my dream job, but then politics ruined it. That's when I gave up."
- "I thought I'd found true love, but betrayal destroyed me. I can't trust anymore."

#### Components of Contamination Narratives

**1. Initial Positivity**
- "Things were good"
- Establishes baseline happiness

**2. Disruptive Event**
- "Then X happened"
- Often sudden, traumatic

**3. Irreversible Decline**
- "Everything changed for the worse"
- No recovery
- "I've never been the same"

**4. Loss of Innocence/Hope**
- "I learned the world is cruel"
- Cynicism, bitterness
- Defensive withdrawal

**5. Victim Stance**
- "Life happened TO me"
- Low agency
- Helplessness

#### Correlates of Redemption vs. Contamination

**Research:** McAdams et al. (2001), Adler et al. (2016)

**Redemption Narratives Associated With:**
- Higher life satisfaction (r = .45)
- Lower depression (r = -.38)
- Greater well-being
- More prosocial behavior
- Generativity
- Psychological growth

**Contamination Narratives Associated With:**
- Higher depression (r = .52)
- Lower life satisfaction
- PTSD symptoms
- Anxiety
- Hopelessness
- Stuckness

**Important Note:** Correlation, not causation
- Does contamination narrative cause depression?
- Or does depression lead to contamination narrative?
- Likely bidirectional

### Narrative Complexity

**Beyond Binary:**
Redemption vs. Contamination is oversimplified

**Adler et al. (2016): Narrative Complexity**

#### Simple Narratives
- Single theme dominates
- All-or-nothing thinking
- "My life is nothing but suffering"
- "Everything always works out"

**Associated With:**
- Lower psychological health
- Less resilience
- Rigid thinking

#### Complex Narratives
- Multiple themes coexist
- Nuance and ambiguity
- "I've had both triumphs and failures, and both have taught me"
- Dialectical thinking

**Associated With:**
- Higher well-being
- Greater resilience
- Wisdom
- Emotional maturity

**Example of Complexity:**
"Losing my father was devastating [contamination]. But it brought my siblings and me closer [redemption]. I still grieve, and I'm also grateful for the time we had [holding both]."

### Redemptive vs. Tragic Endings

**Additional Dimension:** How does the story end?

#### Redemptive Life Story
**Structure:** Suffering → Growth → Positive present/future
**Current State:** "I'm in a good place now because of what I overcame"

#### Tragic Life Story
**Structure:** Early promise → Downfall → Negative present/future
**Current State:** "Everything went wrong and I can't recover"

#### Still Unfolding
**Structure:** Ongoing struggle with uncertain outcome
**Current State:** "The story isn't over yet"

**Research:** King et al. (2000)
- Redemptive endings: Associated with maturity, ego development
- Tragic endings: Associated with depression, low self-esteem

## Development Across Lifespan

### Emergence of Narrative Identity

**Habermas & Bluck (2000): Developmental Trajectory**

#### Infancy-Early Childhood (0-3)
**Cognitive Capacity:**
- No narrative identity yet
- Episodic memory developing
- No concept of continuous self over time

**Parental Influence:**
- Parents tell child's story to child
- "Remember when you..."
- Laying foundation

#### Preschool (3-5)
**Cognitive Capacity:**
- Can tell simple stories with beginning, middle, end
- Emerging autobiographical memory
- But no life story yet (too short a life)

**Narrative Skills:**
- "And then... and then..." structure
- Temporal sequencing
- Causal understanding limited

#### Middle Childhood (6-12)
**Cognitive Capacity:**
- Autobiographical reasoning begins
- "This happened BECAUSE..."
- Can explain why events are significant

**Cultural Learning:**
- Internalizing cultural master narratives
- Learning genre expectations (success stories, tragedy, comedy)

**Family Stories:**
- Absorbing family narratives
- "Our family is..."
- These become part of self-narrative

#### Adolescence (13-18)
**CRITICAL PERIOD for narrative identity formation**

**Why Now?**
- **Cognitive Development:** Abstract thinking (Piaget's formal operations)
- **Identity Crisis:** Erikson's "Identity vs. Role Confusion"
- **Social Demand:** "Who are you?" becomes pressing question
- **Looking Ahead:** Future planning requires life story

**Process:**
- Experimenting with different identities
- Trying on narratives ("Maybe I'm the artistic type," "Maybe I'm the rebel")
- High narrative instability

**Habermas & Bluck: Four Coherence Skills Develop**

1. **Temporal Coherence** (age 8-12)
   - Events in chronological order

2. **Biographical Coherence** (age 12-16)
   - Connecting to personal development
   - "That experience shaped who I am"

3. **Causal Coherence** (age 14-18)
   - Explaining why events led to each other
   - "Because X, then Y"

4. **Thematic Coherence** (age 16-20)
   - Identifying overarching life themes
   - "My life is about..."

#### Emerging Adulthood (18-25)
**Arnett (2000): Extended Identity Exploration**

**Narrative Work:**
- Consolidating identity story
- Commitment to particular narrative
- Less experimentation, more stability

**Influences:**
- Education choices
- Career beginnings
- Romantic relationships
- Geographical moves

**Key Question:** "Who am I becoming?"

#### Young Adulthood (25-40)
**Narrative Consolidation**

**Focus:**
- Integration of different life domains into coherent story
  - Career identity
  - Romantic identity
  - Parental identity (if applicable)
  - Friend identity

**Challenge:**
Maintaining coherent self across multiple roles

#### Middle Adulthood (40-65)
**Generativity vs. Stagnation (Erikson)**

**Narrative Shift:**
- From "What's my story?" to "What's my legacy?"
- Concern for next generation
- Mentoring, teaching, creating

**McAdams: Generativity Stories**
- Successful midlife: Stories of contributing to society
- Stagnation: Stories of self-focus, disappointment

#### Late Adulthood (65+)
**Life Review (Butler, 1963)**

**Narrative Work:**
- Reviewing entire life story for coherence
- Integrating successes and failures
- Making peace with choices

**Erikson: Integrity vs. Despair**
- **Integrity:** "My life makes sense as a whole. I have no major regrets."
- **Despair:** "My life was wasted. I have regrets I can't resolve."

**Narrative Resolution:**
- Coherent life story → Integrity → Well-being
- Fragmented or tragic life story → Despair → Poor well-being

## Narrative Themes and Well-Being

### Agency and Communion (Bakan, 1966; McAdams, 1985)

**Two Fundamental Themes in Human Existence:**

#### Agency
**Definition:** Self-mastery, achievement, power, individuation

**In Narratives:**
- "I accomplished..."
- "I controlled..."
- "I succeeded..."
- "I overcame..."

**High Agency Stories:**
- Protagonist as active agent
- Making things happen
- Overcoming obstacles through effort

**Low Agency Stories:**
- Protagonist as passive victim
- Things happen TO protagonist
- Helplessness

**Correlates:**
- High agency: Better mental health, life satisfaction
- BUT: Excessive agency (no communion) = Loneliness

#### Communion
**Definition:** Connection, intimacy, love, belonging

**In Narratives:**
- "We shared..."
- "I felt loved..."
- "I belong to..."
- "I helped..."

**High Communion Stories:**
- Emphasis on relationships
- Belonging to groups
- Caring for others

**Low Communion Stories:**
- Isolation
- Rejection
- Disconnection

**Correlates:**
- High communion: Emotional well-being, social support
- BUT: Excessive communion (no agency) = Loss of self

#### Optimal Balance

**Research:** McAdams (1985, 2006)

**Finding:** Healthiest narratives contain BOTH agency and communion

**Example:**
"I worked hard to become a doctor [agency], and now I use that position to help underserved communities [communion]."

**American Bias:**
US culture overemphasizes agency ("I did it myself")
Collectivist cultures emphasize communion more

### Exploratory Processing

**Research:** Pals (2006)

**Definition:** Deeply exploring difficult experiences to extract meaning

**In Narratives:**
- Not just describing what happened
- Analyzing why it happened
- Considering multiple perspectives
- Extracting lessons

**Example:**

**Low Exploratory:**
"My parents divorced. It was bad. The end."

**High Exploratory:**
"My parents divorced when I was 10. At first, I blamed myself—thought I'd caused it. Over time, I came to understand their incompatibility. Now I see it as sad but necessary. It taught me that sometimes the right choice still involves pain. I'm more thoughtful about my own relationship because of it."

**Correlates:**
- High exploratory processing: Greater well-being, post-traumatic growth
- Especially important after trauma

### Meaning-Making

**Research:** Park (2010), King & Hicks (2021)

**Two Types of Meaning:**

#### 1. Comprehensibility
"I understand what happened and why"

**In Narratives:**
- Causal explanations
- Coherent sequence
- "That happened because..."

#### 2. Significance
"It mattered. It has meaning for my life."

**In Narratives:**
- Connection to values
- Impact on identity
- "That experience taught me..."

**Both Required for Well-Being:**
- Comprehensibility without significance = "I get it, but so what?"
- Significance without comprehensibility = Confusion, rumination

**Optimal:**
"I understand why it happened [comprehensibility] and how it made me who I am [significance]."

---

## Collective Narratives

### Shared Narratives and Group Identity

**Research:** Wertsch (2002), Hammack (2008)

**Concept:** Groups (nations, families, organizations) have master narratives that individuals internalize

### National Narratives

#### American National Narrative

**Master Narrative:**
"America is the land of opportunity where anyone, through hard work, can succeed. We value freedom, individualism, and progress."

**Internalization:**
- Americans tell personal stories in redemptive structure (rags to riches)
- Value agency highly
- Optimism about future

#### Israeli-Palestinian Narratives

**Research:** Hammack (2008)

**Israeli Narrative:**
"We are a persecuted people who finally have a homeland. We must defend it against those who want to destroy us."

**Palestinian Narrative:**
"We are an occupied people fighting for our land and freedom against an oppressive force."

**Result:**
- Same events, radically different interpretations
- Personal narratives align with collective narrative
- Conflict perpetuated by narrative incompatibility

#### Chinese National Narrative

**"Century of Humiliation" (1839-1949):**
"We were a great civilization brought low by Western imperialism. Now we are rising again to reclaim our rightful place."

**Internalization:**
- Chinese individuals often include themes of collective redemption
- National pride linked to overcoming past humiliation

### Family Narratives

**Research:** Fivush et al. (2006), Duke & Fivush (2008)

**Types of Family Stories:**

#### 1. Origin Stories
"How our family came to be"
- Immigration stories
- How parents met
- Family name history

#### 2. Survival Stories
"How we overcame adversity"
- Depression-era struggles
- War experiences
- Illness survival

#### 3. Value Stories
"What our family stands for"
- "We Johnsons always help our neighbors"
- "Education is everything in this family"
- "We don't quit"

#### The "Do You Know?" Scale (Duke & Fivush, 2008)

**Study:**
Asked children: "Do you know..."
- Where your grandparents grew up?
- How your parents met?
- About an illness or hardship a family member faced?
- (20 questions total)

**Finding:**
Children who knew more family stories had:
- Higher self-esteem (r = .42)
- Better emotional regulation
- Stronger sense of identity
- Greater resilience

**Most Powerful Narrative Type:**

**Oscillating Narrative:**
"Our family has had ups and downs. Grandpa built the business, then it almost failed, but Grandma saved it, then it struggled again, but we persevered..."

**Why Powerful?**
- Realistic (not all good or all bad)
- Shows resilience
- Models coping with adversity
- Creates pride without perfectionism

**Least Powerful:**
- Ascending only: "We've always been successful" (unrealistic)
- Descending only: "We're cursed—everything goes wrong" (hopeless)

### Organizational Narratives

**Research:** Boyce (1995)

**Company Origin Stories:**
- Apple: "Rebels in a garage challenging IBM"
- Disney: "Dreamer who believed in magic"
- Nike: "Athletes designing better shoes from a waffle iron"

**Employee Impact:**
- Internalize company narrative as part of personal identity
- "I work at Apple because I'm a creative rebel too"
- Narrative alignment predicts engagement, retention

---

## Narrative Therapy

**Founders:** Michael White & David Epston (1990)

**Core Premise:** Problems are separate from people; stories can be rewritten

### Key Techniques

#### 1. Externalization

**Concept:** The problem is not YOU; it's something affecting you

**Language Shift:**
- From: "I am depressed"
- To: "Depression has been visiting me"

**Effect:**
- Creates agency (can fight external problem)
- Reduces shame (not personal failure)
- Opens possibility of change (can send problem away)

**Example Application:**

**Therapist:** "Tell me about a time Depression wasn't in control. What was different?"

**Client:** "Last week, I went for a walk despite Depression telling me to stay in bed."

**Therapist:** "So you stood up to Depression? How did you do that?"

**Result:** Client sees self as agent, not victim

#### 2. Unique Outcomes (Exceptions)

**Concept:** Find times when problem didn't dominate

**Process:**
1. Identify exception: "When hasn't the problem been present?"
2. Explore it deeply: "What was different? What did you do?"
3. Link to identity: "What does that exception say about who you are?"

**Example:**

**Client:** "I'm always anxious."

**Therapist:** "Always? Has there ever been a moment without anxiety?"

**Client:** "Well... when I'm painting, I guess I forget about anxiety."

**Therapist:** "Interesting! So there's a version of you that anxiety can't touch—the artist. Tell me more about that person."

**Result:** Alternative narrative emerges—not defined by anxiety

#### 3. Re-Authoring

**Concept:** Client becomes author of new narrative

**Process:**
1. **Deconstruct dominant story:** "How did you come to believe this about yourself?"
2. **Identify alternative story pieces:** Exceptions, strengths, values
3. **Author new story:** "If you were writing your life story differently, what would it say?"
4. **Live new story:** "What would Character-in-New-Story do in this situation?"

**Example:**

**Old Story:**
"I'm damaged from childhood abuse. I'll never be normal. I'm broken."

**Re-Authored Story:**
"I survived childhood abuse. That survival showed incredible strength. I'm not broken—I'm a survivor who's learning to thrive. My story is about resilience."

**Not Denying Reality:**
- Abuse still happened (factual past unchanged)
- But meaning and identity shift
- From victim identity to survivor identity

#### 4. Witnessing and Audience

**Concept:** Telling new story to supportive audience solidifies it

**Process:**
- Client tells re-authored story to therapist, then to safe others
- Witnesses reflect back: "I heard your story of resilience..."
- Public telling creates accountability and validation

**Why It Works:**
- Social confirmation of new identity
- Harder to revert to old story once publicly claimed
- Creates new social narrative

### Evidence Base for Narrative Therapy

**Research:** Etchison & Kleist (2000), Vromans & Schweitzer (2011)

**Meta-Analysis Findings:**
- Effective for depression (d = 0.58, moderate effect)
- Effective for anxiety (d = 0.46)
- Particularly effective for trauma survivors
- Works across cultures

**Mechanism:**
Changing narrative → Changing identity → Changing behavior

---

## Cultural Variations

### Individualist vs. Collectivist Narratives

**Research:** Markus & Kitayama (1991), Wang (2001)

#### Western (Individualist) Narratives

**Structure:**
- Individual protagonist
- Personal agency emphasized
- "I achieved..."
- Linear progression toward goals
- Clear resolution

**Example:**
"I decided to change careers. I researched options, went back to school, and now I'm a successful entrepreneur."

**Focus:** Personal autonomy and achievement

#### Eastern (Collectivist) Narratives

**Structure:**
- Collective or relational focus
- "We..." more than "I..."
- Context and relationships emphasized
- Circular or spiral progression
- Acceptance of ambiguity

**Example:**
"My family expected me to join the family business. I considered other paths but understood my responsibility. Through honoring this duty, I found unexpected satisfaction."

**Focus:** Social harmony and role fulfillment

### Cultural Master Narratives (Hammack, 2008)

**Definition:** Culture-wide templates for life stories

**Examples:**

#### American Dream
- Poor immigrant → Hard work → Success → "I made it"
- Redemptive structure
- Agency emphasized

#### Japanese "Gambaru" (Perseverance)
- Facing difficulty → Enduring without complaint → Gradual improvement through effort
- Stoicism valued
- Collective benefit

#### Indian Karma Narrative
- Current circumstances from past actions (this life or previous)
- Life lessons to be learned
- Spiritual growth through experiences

**Effect:** Individuals construct personal narratives to fit cultural templates

---

## Narrative Coherence

**Research:** Habermas & Bluck (2000), Reese et al. (2011)

### What is Coherence?

**Definition:** How well a life story "hangs together" as a unified, sensible narrative

### Four Types of Coherence

#### 1. Temporal Coherence
**Definition:** Events in order, clear timeline

**High:**
"I was born in 1985. At age 10, my father died. When I was 16, I moved to live with my aunt. At 18, I started college..."

**Low:**
"I lived with my aunt. Before that... or was it after? I think I was in college... or maybe high school. My father died somewhere in there."

**Importance:** Basic requirement for comprehensible story

#### 2. Causal Coherence
**Definition:** Clear cause-effect relationships

**High:**
"My father's death devastated me, which led to poor school performance. That forced me to repeat a year. Because of that delay, I discovered theater, which changed my life direction."

**Low:**
"My father died. I did poorly in school. I got into theater."
(Same events, no causal connections)

**Importance:** Explains WHY things happened, creates meaningful sequence

#### 3. Thematic Coherence
**Definition:** Overarching themes connect disparate experiences

**High:**
"Looking at my life, I see a theme of 'finding family.' I lost my birth family, but created chosen family through theater, then built my own family. Family—blood or chosen—is my throughline."

**Low:**
Multiple unconnected stories with no linking theme

**Importance:** Provides unity and deeper meaning

#### 4. Cultural Coherence
**Definition:** Story makes sense within cultural context

**High:**
Story follows cultural narrative templates, recognizable genre

**Low:**
Story violates cultural expectations, confuses listeners

**Example of Violation:**
American who tells descending narrative ("I had success but lost it and can't recover") violates American Dream redemption expectation—may be seen as giving up

### Coherence and Well-Being

**Research:** Baerger & McAdams (1999)

**Finding:**
Coherence correlates with well-being (r = .35-.45)

**Mechanism:**
- Coherent story = Sense of understanding life
- Understanding = Control and meaning
- Meaning = Well-being

**Caveat:**
- Too rigid coherence can be problematic (forces experiences into preset narrative, ignores nuance)
- Optimal: Coherent but flexible

---

## Applications

### 1. Therapy

**Use:** Help clients construct healthier narratives

**Process:**
- Identify current narrative (often contamination or victim story)
- Find exceptions and strengths
- Co-author alternative narrative (redemption or complexity)
- Strengthen new narrative through retelling

### 2. Life Coaching

**Use:** Clarify goals through narrative lens

**Process:**
- "What's your story so far?"
- "What story do you want to live going forward?"
- Identify narrative discontinuities (where current behavior doesn't match desired story)
