## Defining Suspense

### Suspense vs. Related States

**Research:** Brewer & Lichtenstein (1982)

#### Suspense
**Definition:** Uncertainty about future events + Concern about outcomes

**Characteristics:**
- Forward-looking (What will happen?)
- Anxiety/tension
- Anticipation
- Hope + Fear

**Example:**
Bomb under table ticking. Will hero discover it in time?

#### Surprise
**Definition:** Unexpected event violating expectations

**Characteristics:**
- Present moment shock
- Disorientation
- Need to revise mental model

**Example:**
Bomb explodes without warning.

#### Curiosity
**Definition:** Desire to know missing information

**Characteristics:**
- Gap in knowledge
- Can be past or present (not future)
- "What happened? Why?"

**Example:**
After explosion: What caused it? Who planted the bomb?

### Components of Suspense (Zillmann, 1980, 1996)

**Three Requirements:**

#### 1. Initiatory Event
- Something happens that creates uncertainty
- Introduces threat or opportunity
- Sets stakes

**Example:** Villain plants bomb on bus

#### 2. Possible Outcomes
- Multiple futures imaginable
- At least two opposing outcomes (good/bad)
- Both must seem plausible

**Example:**
- Good outcome: Passengers escape
- Bad outcome: Bomb explodes, casualties

#### 3. Temporal Delay
- Time between initiatory event and outcome
- Creates sustained tension
- Too short: No time for suspense to build
- Too long: Audience stops caring

**Example:** 60-minute timer on bomb

### Mathematical Model of Suspense

**Zillmann's Formula:**

```
Suspense = P(negative outcome) × Value(positive outcome) × Duration × Attachment
```

**Where:**

**P(negative outcome):**
- Probability bad thing will happen
- Sweet spot: 40-60% (maximum uncertainty)
- Too low: No tension (obviously safe)
- Too high: Hopeless (why care?)

**Value(positive outcome):**
- How much we care
- Determined by character attachment
- Higher attachment = Higher suspense

**Duration:**
- Time until resolution
- Optimal: Long enough to build, short enough to sustain
- Typically: Minutes to hours (rarely days)

**Attachment:**
- Emotional investment in characters
- More we care, more suspenseful

**Example Calculation:**

Low Suspense Story:
- P(negative) = 10% (clearly safe)
- Value = Moderate (likable character)
- Duration = 2 minutes (too short)
- **Result:** Minimal suspense

High Suspense Story:
- P(negative) = 50% (truly uncertain)
- Value = High (beloved character)
- Duration = 45 minutes (sustained)
- **Result:** Maximum suspense

## Information Gap Theory

**Developed by:** George Loewenstein (1994)

### Core Mechanism

**Curiosity as Information Gap:**

```
Know Something → Reference to Unknown → Gap Perceived → Curiosity Aroused → Seek Information
```

**Key Insight:** Curiosity is UNCOMFORTABLE

- Not pleasurable desire
- Cognitive "itch" demanding scratch
- Like hunger or thirst
- Must be resolved

### Five Factors Triggering Curiosity

#### 1. Question Framing

**Research:** Berlyne (1954)

**Effect:** Explicit question > Vague uncertainty

**Examples:**

**Weak:** "Something interesting ahead"
→ Low curiosity (no specific gap)

**Strong:** "Who killed the mayor?"
→ High curiosity (clear gap)

**Application:**
Open narrative loops explicitly through questions

#### 2. Confidence in Answer Existence

**Finding:** Curiosity strongest when answer definitely exists

**Low Curiosity:**
"What is the meaning of life?"
→ Unanswerable, no specific information can close gap

**High Curiosity:**
"What's in the locked box?"
→ Answerable, specific information exists

**Application:**
Signal that answer is coming to maintain engagement

#### 3. Utility of Knowledge

**Finding:** Greater curiosity for useful information

**Examples:**

**Low Utility:**
"What's the etymology of 'suspense'?"
→ Interesting but not useful

**High Utility:**
"How do I create suspense in my story?"
→ Directly applicable

**Application:**
Frame information as useful to audience

#### 4. Violation of Expectations

**Research:** Loewenstein (1994)

**Trigger:** Anomaly or surprise

**Process:**
1. Expectation formed
2. Expectation violated
3. "That's weird!" → Curiosity
4. Must explain anomaly

**Example:**
Expect: All swans are white
Observe: Black swan
Result: Intense curiosity about explanation

**Application:**
Present unexpected fact, then explain

#### 5. Priming

**Research:** Loewenstein & Nisan (1974)

**Effect:** Activating related knowledge increases curiosity

**Mechanism:**
- Remind of what they know
- Introduce gap adjacent to known
- "You know A and B, but what about C?"

**Example:**

**No Priming:**
"Today we discuss neural coupling."
→ Moderate curiosity

**With Priming:**
"You know your brain processes language. But did you know when you hear a story, your brain activity SYNCHRONIZES with the speaker's brain? Let me explain how..."
→ Higher curiosity (primed language knowledge, then gap)

### The Curiosity Curve

```
Curiosity Intensity
        ↑
    Peak (Optimal)
        |    /\
        |  /    \
        |/        \
        +——————————→ Information Provided
    None  Some  Moderate  Near-Complete  Complete
```

**Zone Analysis:**

**No Information (0%):**
- No gap perceived
- No curiosity

**Minimal Information (10-20%):**
- Gap too large
- Feels unanswerable
- Low curiosity

**Optimal Zone (30-70%):**
- Gap clear and closeable
- Maximum curiosity
- "I can figure this out!"

**Near-Complete (80-90%):**
- Just need final piece
- Moderate curiosity
- Satisfaction approaching

**Complete Information (100%):**
- No gap
- No curiosity
- But satisfaction achieved

**Application for Storytellers:**

**Opening:** Provide 30-40% information
- Enough to understand question
- Not enough to answer it

**Middle:** Gradually increase to 60-70%
- Maintain gap
- Add complexity

**Climax:** Jump to 90-100%
- Answer revealed
- Satisfaction delivered

## The Zeigarnik Effect

**Discovered by:** Bluma Zeigarnik (1927)

### Original Study

**Setting:** Restaurant in Vienna

**Observation:**
Waiters perfectly remembered incomplete orders but forgot completed ones

**Experiment:**
- Participants given 20 simple tasks (puzzles, crafts)
- Half allowed to complete, half interrupted
- Tested memory later

**Result:**
- Interrupted tasks: Remembered 90%
- Completed tasks: Remembered 50%

**Conclusion:** Uncompleted tasks create cognitive tension that enhances memory

### Modern Interpretation

**Cognitive Mechanism:**

**1. Goal Activation**
- Starting task activates goal representation in memory
- Goal = "Complete this task"

**2. Persistent Activation**
- Until goal achieved, representation stays active
- Uses cognitive resources (background processing)
- Creates intrusive thoughts

**3. Resolution**
- Completing task deactivates goal
- Can forget (no longer needed)
- Cognitive relief

**In Stories:**

**Unresolved narrative loop = Active goal = Can't stop thinking about it**

### Applications in Storytelling

#### 1. Cliffhangers

**Mechanism:**
- Episode/chapter ends with major question unresolved
- Zeigarnik effect keeps it active in memory
- Must watch next episode to resolve

**Example:**
*Game of Thrones* season finales
- Major character in danger
- Fade to black
- Audience: 10 months of speculation

#### 2. Serial Narratives

**Dickens' Strategy:**
- Novels published chapter by chapter
- Each installment ends with unresolved tension
- Readers anticipated next installment

**Modern:**
- TV series (weekly episodes)
- Podcast series
- Book series

#### 3. Subplots

**Strategy:**
- Multiple narrative threads
- Resolve some, keep others open
- Audience maintains engagement across interruptions

**Example:**
Main plot resolves at end of episode, but subplot (romance, mystery) continues
→ Reason to return

### The Dark Side: Exploitation

#### Compulsive Behaviors

**Social Media:**
- Endless scroll = Never-ending loop
- Notifications = Incomplete social interactions
- Must check to resolve

**Research:** Alter (2017) - "Irresistible"
- Social media engineered for Zeigarnik exploitation
- Artificial incomplete loops

**Gambling:**
- "Near miss" = Incomplete resolution
- Must try again

**Application Ethics:**
Balance engagement with respect for audience autonomy

## Curiosity and Dopamine

**Research:** Kang et al. (2009), Gruber et al. (2014)

### The Neuroscience of Curiosity

#### fMRI Studies

**Kang et al. (2009): "The Wick in the Candle of Learning"**

**Method:**
- Present trivia questions
- Rate curiosity (1-6 scale)
- fMRI scanning
- Present answers

**Findings:**

**High Curiosity Questions:**
- Caudate activation (dopamine system)
- Nucleus accumbens activation (reward anticipation)
- Similar pattern to hunger, drug craving

**Low Curiosity Questions:**
- Minimal activation in reward circuits

**Conclusion:** Curiosity activates reward system as if anticipating primary reward

#### Dopamine and Anticipation

**Key Insight:** Dopamine = Wanting, not having

**In Stories:**

**Question Raised:**
→ Dopamine begins release
→ Anticipation of resolution
→ Motivation to continue

**Answer Approaching:**
→ Dopamine increases
→ Getting closer!

**Answer Revealed:**
→ Dopamine peak
→ Reward obtained
→ Satisfaction

**Next Question Raised:**
→ Cycle repeats

### The Curiosity-Memory Connection

**Gruber et al. (2014): "States of Curiosity Modulate Hippocampus-Dependent Learning"**

**Finding:**
High curiosity state enhances memory for:
1. The answer to curiosity-inducing question (expected)
2. **Incidental information presented during high-curiosity state** (surprising!)

**Implication:**
- Raise curiosity about main point
- Then present related information
- Audience will remember even "boring" details because brain in high-curiosity state

**Educational Application:**

**Traditional:**
"Today's topic: Photosynthesis. It's the process by which..."
→ Low curiosity, poor retention

**Curiosity-First:**
"Plants don't eat. No mouth. So how does a tree gain 100 tons of mass? Where does it come from?"
→ High curiosity
"The answer: mostly from air. Through photosynthesis..."
→ Enhanced retention

## Suspense Structures

### 1. The Ticking Clock

**Structure:**
- Definite deadline
- Time running out
- Increasing pressure

**Psychological Effect:**
- External time matches narrative time
- Audience feels urgency
- Physiological arousal increases

**Examples:**
- Bomb timer counting down
- 24 hours to prevent war
- "You have 60 seconds to decide"

**Why Effective:**
- Concrete, measurable threat
- Clear endpoint
- Escalating tension

**Hitchcock:** "Bomb under table"
Show audience bomb + timer = Maximum suspense

### 2. Near Misses

**Structure:**
- Almost caught
- Almost succeeded
- Almost discovered

**Psychological Effect:**
- Each near miss resets arousal higher
- "Whew, safe!" → Brief relief → Higher baseline

**Example Progression:**

**Near Miss 1:** Hero hides in closet, villain opens door, almost sees hero
→ Arousal: Medium

**Near Miss 2:** Hero sneaks past guard, guard turns just as hero rounds corner
→ Arousal: Higher (didn't fully relax from Miss 1)

**Near Miss 3:** Hero climbing out window, guard enters room
→ Arousal: Peak

**Final Outcome:** Hero escapes
→ Massive relief (amplified by accumulated tension)

**Research:** Reid (1986)
- Near misses activate brain reward system similarly to wins
- Create compulsion to continue
- Explains gambling persistence

### 3. Dramatic Irony

**Structure:**
- Audience knows what character doesn't
- Character walking into danger/opportunity unknowingly

**Psychological Effect:**
- Audience wants to warn character
- Helplessness increases tension
- Superior position (know more) + Powerlessness (can't intervene) = Suspense

**Example:**

**Horror:** Audience sees killer in closet; character enters room
→ "Don't go in there!"

**Romance:** Audience knows two people are perfect for each other; characters don't realize yet
→ "Just kiss already!"

**Thriller:** Audience knows protagonist's partner is traitor; protagonist trusts them
→ "Don't tell them the plan!"

**Hitchcock's Theory:**

**Scenario A (Surprise):**
Two people talking. Boom! Bomb explodes.
→ Surprise for 10 seconds

**Scenario B (Suspense):**
Audience sees bomb under table (5 minutes on timer). Two people talk about mundane topics.
→ Suspense for 5 minutes

**Hitchcock:** "Always show the bomb."

### 4. Multi-Layered Uncertainty

**Structure:**
- Multiple unresolved questions simultaneously
- Different types of stakes

**Example (TV Drama):**

**Layer 1 (Physical):** Will protagonist survive the attack?
**Layer 2 (Relational):** Will their marriage survive the betrayal?
**Layer 3 (Moral):** Will they maintain their principles or compromise?
**Layer 4 (Mystery):** Who is the mole?

**Psychological Effect:**
- Even when one resolves, others maintain engagement
- Appeals to different audience interests
- Richer, more complex narrative texture

### 5. Unreliable Narrator

**Structure:**
- Can't trust what we're told
- Uncertainty about reality itself

**Psychological Effect:**
- Two mysteries: What happened? + What's true?
- Must actively question and re-evaluate
- Higher cognitive engagement

**Examples:**
- Fight Club (Is Marla real?)
- The Usual Suspects (Is Verbal lying?)
- Gone Girl (Whose account is accurate?)

**When Revelation Occurs:**
- Must mentally reconstruct entire narrative
- "Oh! That's why..."
- Rewatching/rereading reveals hidden clues

---

## The Paradox of Suspense

**Puzzle:** Why suspense during re-watching when outcome known?

**Research:** Gerrig (1989), Brewer (1996), Yanal (1996)

### Theories

#### 1. Anomalous Suspense Theory

**Proposition:** We temporarily "forget" the outcome

**Mechanism:**
- Deep transportation suppresses memory
- Immersion overrides knowledge
- Experience story "as if" first time

**Evidence:**
- Subjective reports of suspense despite knowledge
- Physiological arousal (heart rate) even on re-watch

**Critique:**
- Doesn't explain why some stories more suspenseful on rewatch
- People clearly remember they know outcome

#### 2. Structural Affect Theory

**Proposition:** Suspense from narrative structure, not outcome uncertainty

**Mechanism:**
- Formal features create tension independent of uncertainty
- Rising action, pacing, music, editing
- Structure itself creates arousal

**Evidence:**
- Can feel suspense in stories where outcome certain (historical events)
- Some stories MORE suspenseful on rewatch (notice foreshadowing)

#### 3. Moment-by-Moment Uncertainty

**Proposition:** Even knowing ultimate outcome, moment-to-moment events uncertain

**Mechanism:**
- Know hero survives film, but not each individual scene
- "How do they escape THIS situation?"
- Process micro-uncertainties even when macro-outcome known

**Example:**
- Know Titanic sinks (historical fact)
- Still suspenseful: Will Jack and Rose survive? How do they try?

#### 4. Imaginative Resistance

**Proposition:** Difficulty fully believing fictional world

**Mechanism:**
- Part of us always knows "it's fiction"
- Creates psychological distance
- Room for suspense even when "know" outcome

### Integrated Account

**Most Likely:** All mechanisms contribute

- Structure creates tension
- Transportation suppresses meta-knowledge
- Micro-uncertainties sustain engagement
- Good stories work on multiple viewings because structure itself compelling

## Near-Miss Psychology

**Research:** Reid (1986), Clark et al. (2009)

### Near-Miss Definition

**Close to desired outcome but didn't achieve it**

Examples:
- Slot machine: Cherry-Cherry-Lemon (almost jackpot!)
- Sports: Ball hits goalpost (almost scored!)
- Stories: Hero almost escapes (caught at last second)

### Neurological Response

**fMRI Studies (Clark et al., 2009):**

**Setup:**
- Participants play slot machine in scanner
- Win, Loss, or Near-Miss outcomes

**Brain Activation:**

**Win:** Reward system activation (striatum)
**Loss:** Minimal activation
**Near Miss:** REWARD SYSTEM ACTIVATION (similar to win!)

**Key Finding:**
Brain treats near-misses like wins, not losses

### Psychological Effects

#### 1. Continued Motivation

**Effect:** Near miss → Increased persistence

**Mechanism:**
- Feels like "almost there"
- Just need "one more try"
- Optimism bias

**In Gambling:**
- Near misses increase betting
- "I'm getting closer!"
- Contributes to compulsive gambling

**In Stories:**
- Near misses maintain hope
- "They can still make it!"
- Continued engagement

#### 2. Heightened Arousal

**Effect:** Each near miss elevates baseline arousal

**Mechanism:**
- Stress response activated
- Brief relief when escape
- But doesn't fully return to baseline
- Ratcheting effect

**Example (Chase Scene):**

**Near Miss 1:** Hero ducks into alley, pursuer runs past
→ Relief, but arousal stays elevated

**Near Miss 2:** Hero hides behind car, pursuer checks nearby
→ More relief, arousal even higher

**Near Miss 3:** Hero climbs fence, pursuer grabs ankle
→ Peak arousal

**Finally Escapes:**
→ Massive relief (enhanced by accumulated tension)

#### 3. Memorable Moments

**Effect:** Near misses disproportionately memorable

**Mechanism:**
- High arousal → Enhanced encoding
- Emotional intensity
- "Almost" moments salient

**In Stories:**
- Near-miss scenes often most remembered
- "I can't believe they almost died there!"

## Cliffhangers and Binge-Watching

### The Cliffhanger Strategy

**Definition:** Ending episode/chapter at moment of high suspense

**Psychological Mechanisms:**

#### 1. Zeigarnik Effect
- Unresolved loop stays active
- Intrusive thoughts between episodes
- Must resolve

#### 2. Dopamine Loop
- Question raised but not answered
- Dopamine system seeking resolution
- "Just one more episode..."

#### 3. Peak-End Rule
- Episode ends at peak tension
- Final impression = Intense
- Episode judged as more engaging overall

### Binge-Watching Phenomenon

**Research:** Flayelle et al. (2019), Matrix (2014)

**Definition:** Watching multiple episodes in single sitting

**Facilitated by:**
- Streaming platforms (Netflix model)
- Autoplay (reduces friction)
- Cliffhangers (motivation)

**Psychological Process:**

**Episode 1 Ends:**
→ Cliffhanger
→ Must know what happens
→ "Just one more"

**Episode 2 Ends:**
→ Another cliffhanger
→ Sunk cost ("I'm already invested")
→ "Might as well finish season"

**3 Hours Later:**
→ Entire season complete
→ Time passed unnoticed (flow state)
→ Satisfaction + Exhaustion

### Individual Differences in Susceptibility

**Research:** Matrix et al. (2014)

**Who Binges More?**

**High Binge Tendency:**
- Lower self-regulation
- High need for cognition (want to solve mysteries)
- Avoidance coping (using media to escape stress)
- Loneliness (parasocial relationships substitute)

**Low Binge Tendency:**
- High self-regulation
- Prefer delayed gratification
- Active coping strategies
- Rich real social networks

### Ethical Considerations

**Concerns:**

**1. Exploitation**
- Platforms engineer for compulsive viewing
- Autoplay removes natural stopping point
- "Choice" compromised by design

**2. Health Impacts**
- Sleep deprivation (one more episode → 3 AM)
- Sedentary behavior
- Social isolation

**3. Diminished Enjoyment?**
- Binging may reduce savoring
- No time for reflection
- Less fan community discussion (everyone at different points)

**Counterargument:**
- Viewer agency (can choose to stop)
- Binging as preferred modern consumption
- Satisfaction from immersive experience

## Applications

### For Writers/Creators

**1. Opening Loops Early**
- Raise central question in first 5 minutes
- Multiple questions across episodes/chapters

**2. Strategic Near Misses**
- Use 3-5 near misses before resolution
- Each slightly closer than last

**3. Dramatic Irony**
- Give audience information character lacks
- Selective, not constant (needs relief)

**4. Layered Mysteries**
- Resolve some questions while raising new ones
- Maintain at least one major open loop

**5. Optimal Pacing**
- Moments of relief between tension
- Avoid exhausting audience
- Build to climax

### For Educators

**1. Create Curiosity Before Teaching**
- Pose question before answer
- "Why do you think...?"
- Activates dopamine, enhances memory

**2. Use Cliffhangers**
- End class with intriguing question
- Students think about it until next class

**3. Serial Content**
- Break content into episodes
- Each ends with hook to next

### For Marketers

**1. Mystery Campaigns**
- Teaser ads without full reveal
- Build anticipation

**2. Serial Launches**
- Reveal product features gradually
- Each reveal raises new question

**3. Interactive Content**
- Choose-your-own-adventure
- Builds investment

## Key Takeaways

1. **Suspense = Uncertainty + Care** - Must have both for tension
2. **Curiosity is Dopamine-Driven** - Neurochemical need to close gaps
3. **Unresolved Loops Stay Active** - Zeigarnik effect keeps stories in mind
4. **Near Misses Amplify Tension** - Brain treats as quasi-success
5. **Structure Creates Suspense** - Even when outcome known
6. **Optimal Information: 30-70%** - Too little or too much reduces curiosity
7. **Cliffhangers Exploit Psychology** - Use ethically

**Bottom Line:**
Suspense hijacks brain's information-seeking systems, creating compulsive engagement through managed uncertainty.
