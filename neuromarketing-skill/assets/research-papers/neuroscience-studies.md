- Strong brands change actual sensory experience
- Automatic positive responses measurable
- Consistency builds neural pathways

**3. Social Proof is Hardwired**
- Literally changes perception
- Reduces decision anxiety
- Conformity = evolutionary advantage

**4. First Impressions = Pre-Conscious**
- 3 seconds to decide
- Emotional evaluation before conscious thought
- No second chance

**5. Sensory Details Matter**
- All 5 senses contribute
- Multisensory = 10x more memorable
- Cross-modal effects real

**6. Habits = Competitive Moats**
- 66 days to automate
- Basal ganglia makes effortless
- Hard to break once formed

**7. Choice Architecture Matters**
- Defaults powerful
- Framing affects decisions
- Too much choice = paralysis

**8. Price = Quality Signal**
- Higher price = actual increased pleasure
- Placebo effect neurologically real
- Context affects value perception
