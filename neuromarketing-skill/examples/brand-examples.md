- **Founded:** 1886
- **Industry:** Beverages
- **Brand Value:** $87 billion (Interbrand 2023)

### Neuromarketing Strategies

#### 1. Color Psychology (Red + White)
**Red:**
- Stimulates appetite (+18%)
- Creates excitement and energy
- Highest visibility (recognized globally)
- Passion and vitality association

**White:**
- Purity and refreshment
- Creates contrast (pop effect)
- Cleanliness perception

**Brain Impact:**
- Instantly recognizable (fusiform gyrus, 100ms recognition)
- Emotional arousal (amygdala activation)
- Appetite stimulation (hypothalamus)

#### 2. The Pepsi Challenge Study (fMRI Evidence)

**Blind Test:**
- ~50% preferred each brand
- Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activated equally

**Branded Test:**
- 75% preferred Coca-Cola
- Additional activation: Hippocampus (memory) + dlPFC (cognitive control)
- Brand memories overrode taste preference

**Key Insight:** Brand power changes actual sensory experience at neural level

#### 3. Shape Psychology (Contour Bottle)

**The Bottle:**
- Iconic curves since 1915
- Tactile recognition (can identify by touch alone)
- Feminine curves (subconscious attraction)

**Brain Impact:**
- Visual cortex (distinctive shape = instant recognition)
- Somatosensory cortex (holding bottle = pleasure)

- Bottle alone activates brand associations (no logo needed)

#### 4. Emotional Marketing ("Happiness")

**Campaigns:**
- "Open Happiness" (2009-2016)
