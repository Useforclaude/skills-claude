- Free over $50: +8% conversion, +5% AOV
- "Add $X more": +12% conversion, +18% AOV (optimal)

**Why "Add $X more" Won:**
- Progress bar effect (goal proximity)
- Clear path to reward
- Sunk cost (already in cart)
- Loss aversion (lose free shipping if don't add)

**Key Insight:**
Progressive threshold > absolute threshold (gamification effect)
