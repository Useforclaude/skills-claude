# Color Psychology Deep Dive

## The Science of Color Perception

### How We See Color

**Physical Process:**
1. Light waves enter eye (wavelengths 380-750nm visible spectrum)
2. Cones in retina detect color (3 types: S, M, L)
3. Signal sent to V1 (primary visual cortex) in occipital lobe
4. V4 processes color specifically
5. Integration with memory, emotion in limbic system

**Color Processing Speed:**
- Initial detection: 13 milliseconds
- Conscious awareness: 80 milliseconds
- Emotional association: 100 milliseconds
- Faster than word recognition (200ms)

### Neurological Color Effects

**Physiological Responses:**
- **Wavelength affects physiology:** Red (long wavelength) = arousal, Blue (short wavelength) = calm
- **Autonomic nervous system:** Heart rate, blood pressure, respiration affected
- **Hormone release:** Certain colors trigger cortisol (stress) or serotonin (calm)
- **Circadian rhythms:** Blue light suppresses melatonin, red light doesn't

**Brain Regions Activated:**
- **V4 (color perception):** Primary color processing
- **Amygdala:** Emotional response to colors
- **Hippocampus:** Color memory associations
- **Prefrontal cortex:** Color meaning and cultural interpretation
