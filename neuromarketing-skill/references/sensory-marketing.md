## Multisensory Integration

### Synesthesia in Marketing

**Cross-Modal Effects:**
- One sense influences another
- Example: Red increases perceived sweetness
- Strategy: Align all senses toward same message

### Multisensory Experiences

**Single Sense:** Baseline
**Two Senses:** 2.5x more memorable
**Three Senses:** 4x more memorable
**All Five Senses:** 10x more memorable

**Example - Starbucks:**
1. **Vision:** Green logo, warm lighting, product displays
2. **Auditory:** Curated music, coffee grinding sounds
3. **Olfactory:** Coffee aroma (signature scent)
4. **Tactile:** Warm cup, comfortable seating, textured materials
5. **Gustatory:** Coffee taste, food samples

**Result:** Immersive "third place" experience (not home, not work)

### Sensory Congruence

**Principle:** All senses should tell the same story

**Examples:**
- **Luxury spa:** Soft music + lavender scent + soft fabrics + calm colors
- **Sports bar:** Loud rock music + beer smell + rough textures + bold colors
- **Apple store:** Minimalist visuals + soft music + smooth surfaces + clean scent

**Incongruence Effects:**
