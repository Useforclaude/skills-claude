- Low-pitched = Bitter, deep
- Classical music = 18% more sophisticated taste

### Naming Effects

**Research - Wansink et al. (2005):**
- "Succulent Italian Seafood Filet" = +27% enjoyment
- "Fish Filet" = baseline
- Same identical food, different description

**Examples:**
- "Hand-crafted" = 20% tastier perception
- "Artisan" = Premium perception
- "Grandma's recipe" = Nostalgia and comfort
- "Chef's special" = Quality and exclusivity

### Sampling Strategies

**Free Sample Psychology:**
- **Reciprocity:** 73% feel obligated to buy after tasting
- **Risk reduction:** Try before buy
- **Activation:** Taste triggers desire

**Optimal Sample Size:**
- 1-2 bites: Enough to evaluate, not to satisfy
- Too large: No need to buy
- Too small: Can't evaluate properly

**Optimal Timing:**
- **11am-2pm:** Lunch hunger peak
- **4pm-6pm:** Afternoon hunger
- **Avoid:** Right after meals

**Optimal Placement:**
- Near product being sampled
- High-traffic areas
- Eye level, easy access

**Research - Nordfält (2009):**
- Sampling increases sales by 67%
- Effect lasts 2-3 weeks (trial → purchase)
- Works best for new products or underperformers

## Multisensory Integration

### Synesthesia in Marketing

**Cross-Modal Effects:**
- One sense influences another
- Example: Red increases perceived sweetness
- Strategy: Align all senses toward same message

### Multisensory Experiences

**Single Sense:** Baseline
**Two Senses:** 2.5x more memorable
**Three Senses:** 4x more memorable
**All Five Senses:** 10x more memorable

**Example - Starbucks:**
1. **Vision:** Green logo, warm lighting, product displays
2. **Auditory:** Curated music, coffee grinding sounds
3. **Olfactory:** Coffee aroma (signature scent)
4. **Tactile:** Warm cup, comfortable seating, textured materials
5. **Gustatory:** Coffee taste, food samples

**Result:** Immersive "third place" experience (not home, not work)

### Sensory Congruence

**Principle:** All senses should tell the same story

**Examples:**
- **Luxury spa:** Soft music + lavender scent + soft fabrics + calm colors
- **Sports bar:** Loud rock music + beer smell + rough textures + bold colors
- **Apple store:** Minimalist visuals + soft music + smooth surfaces + clean scent

**Incongruence Effects:**
- Confusion: -15% satisfaction
- Cognitive dissonance
- Reduced trust
