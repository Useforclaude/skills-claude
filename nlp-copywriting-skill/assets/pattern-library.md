[Pattern 121: Mind Reading]
"You're probably wondering if this really works."

[Pattern 136: Pacing & Leading]
"You've tried 5 email tools. They were clunky. You're frustrated."

[Pattern 1: Temporal]
"When you TRY OUR SOFTWARE, you'll see the difference in 60 seconds."

[Pattern 46: Presuppositional Question]
"Which template will you USE FIRST when you SIGN UP—the welcome series or the sales funnel?"

[Pattern 147: Urgency]
"GRAB YOUR FREE TRIAL before this offer ends tonight."
```

**Result:** 5 embedded commands in 5 sentences, all feeling natural.

## FINAL TIPS

### ✅ DO:

- Mix pattern categories (temporal + VAK + presuppositional = varied)
- Test and measure results
- Read aloud before publishing
- Use 3-10 embedded commands per page (not 50!)
- Match pattern intensity to buyer awareness stage

### ❌ DON'T:

- Use the same pattern 10 times in a row (boring!)
- Make it obvious you're using NLP (defeats purpose)
- Overload with commands (feels pushy)
- Use negative commands if brand voice is positive/warm
- Copy patterns word-for-word (adapt to your voice)
