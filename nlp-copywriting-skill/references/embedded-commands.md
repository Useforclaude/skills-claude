# Embedded Commands - Complete Guide

## What Are Embedded Commands?

**Embedded commands** are hypnotic suggestions hidden within normal-sounding sentences. They bypass conscious resistance by being delivered as part of casual conversation or copy.

**Originated from:** Milton Erickson's conversational hypnosis

**Used by:** Master copywriters, NLP practitioners, persuasion experts

---

## Core Principles

### 1. The Conscious vs Subconscious Mind

```
Conscious Mind (Critical Factor)
├─ Analyzes logic
├─ Rejects obvious commands
└─ Filters sales pitches

Subconscious Mind (Pattern Recognition)
├─ Accepts subtle suggestions
├─ Processes hidden commands
└─ Acts on implied directives
```

**Key Insight:** Embedded commands speak directly to the subconscious while the conscious mind processes the overall sentence.

## The 7 Techniques for Embedding Commands

### Technique #1: Voice Tonality Marking (Spoken)

**How it works:** Change voice tone, volume, or tempo when delivering the command portion.

**Example:**
"Many people find that when they **DECIDE TO BUY TODAY**, they feel really good about it."

**In Writing (equivalent):**
- Bold text
- Italics
- Strategic capitalization
- Em dashes or parentheses

**Copywriting Application:**
```markdown
Before:
"Our customers love this product."

After (embedded):
"Our customers love this product because when you **TRY IT FOR 30 DAYS**, you discover how easy life becomes."
```

---

### Technique #2: Nested Loops (Story Stacking)

**Structure:**
```
Story A (open) →
  Story B (open) →
    EMBEDDED COMMAND →
  Story B (close) →
Story A (close)
```

**Example:**
"Yesterday I was talking to Sarah (Story A), and she told me about her friend Mark (Story B) who said the best decision he ever made was to **INVEST IN HIMSELF TODAY** (command). Mark ended up doubling his income (B close). Sarah wished she'd done it sooner (A close)."

**Why it works:** The conscious mind tracks story continuity. The command slips through while the mind waits for story resolution.

**Copywriting Application:**
```markdown
Email Example:

"Last week, I met a woman at Starbucks (A)...

She told me her college roommate (B) had just quit her 9-5...

Her roommate said the turning point was when she **DECIDED TO START HER BUSINESS** (command)...

Within 6 months, she'd replaced her salary (B close)...

The woman at Starbucks? She's launching next month (A close)."
```

---

### Technique #3: Analogical Marking

**How it works:** Use a metaphor or analogy to deliver the command indirectly.

**Example:**
"It's like when you walk into a bakery and the smell of fresh bread makes you **FEEL THAT HUNGER NOW**—suddenly you want it."

**The command:** "FEEL THAT HUNGER NOW" (for the product)

**Copywriting Application:**
```markdown
Before:
"You should buy this course."

After (analogical):
"It's like finding a shortcut on your commute—once you **TAKE THIS PATH**, you wonder why you waited so long."

The command: "TAKE THIS PATH" (buy the course)
```

---

### Technique #4: Quotes Pattern

**Structure:** Attribute the command to someone else.

**Example:**
"My mentor told me, '**BUY THIS STOCK** before everyone else figures it out.'"

**Why it works:** You're not commanding—you're just quoting. No resistance.

**Copywriting Application:**
```markdown
Sales Page:

"Our top customer, Janet from Austin, said:
'I told my sister: **STOP WASTING TIME and GET THIS COURSE**. It changed my life in 3 weeks.'"

The command to reader: "STOP WASTING TIME and GET THIS COURSE"
```

**Advanced Variation - Nested Quotes:**
"John told me that his boss said, 'My wife told me to **INVEST IN THIS TRAINING**,' and it transformed his career."

(Triple-nested command = very subtle)

---

### Technique #5: Temporal Shifts (When/As/While)

**How it works:** Use time-based language to link the command to inevitable actions.

**Key Words:**
- When
- As
- While
- Before
- After
- During

**Examples:**

1. **"When you..."**
   "When you **SIGN UP TODAY**, you'll receive instant access."

2. **"As you..."**
   "As you **READ THROUGH THIS PAGE**, you'll discover why 10,000 people chose us."

3. **"While you..."**
   "While you **COMPLETE YOUR ORDER**, our system prepares your download."

4. **"Before you..."**
   "Before you **MAKE THIS SMART DECISION**, let me show you one more benefit."

5. **"After you..."**
   "After you **JOIN OUR PROGRAM**, the first thing you'll notice is..."

**Why it works:** Presupposes the action will happen. The mind focuses on "when" not "if."

**Copywriting Application:**
```markdown
Email Sequence:

Subject: "What happens after you click 'Buy'"

Body:
"When you **INVEST IN THIS COURSE** (command), here's what happens:

Day 1: You get instant access
Day 2: You complete module 1
Day 7: You see your first results

But before you **START YOUR TRANSFORMATION** (command), I want to answer the #1 question I get..."
```

---

### Technique #6: Awareness Predicates

**How it works:** Draw attention to the command by talking about noticing, realizing, or becoming aware.

**Key Phrases:**
- "You'll notice..."
- "You might realize..."
- "You may become aware..."
- "You'll discover..."
- "You'll find..."

**Examples:**

1. "You'll notice that as you **READ THIS TESTIMONIAL**, you start to feel more confident."

2. "You might realize that when you **TRY THIS FREE TRIAL**, it's exactly what you've been looking for."

3. "You'll discover that after you **CLICK THE BUTTON BELOW**, everything becomes easier."

**Why it works:** The conscious mind focuses on the "noticing" part. The command slips through as part of what will be noticed.

**Copywriting Application:**
```markdown
Landing Page:

"You'll notice three things when you **START USING OUR SOFTWARE**:

1. Tasks that took hours now take minutes
2. Your team collaborates effortlessly
3. You wonder how you worked without it

Most people realize after they **SIGN UP TODAY** that they should have done it months ago."
```

---

### Technique #7: Negative Commands (Reverse Psychology)

**How it works:** Tell someone NOT to do something, which makes them think about doing it.

**Psychological Basis:** The subconscious doesn't process negatives well. "Don't think of a pink elephant" → you think of it.

**Examples:**

1. **"Don't..."**
   "Don't **BUY THIS COURSE** unless you're serious about results."

   (The mind hears: "BUY THIS COURSE if you're serious")

2. **"You don't have to..."**
   "You don't have to **ORDER RIGHT NOW**, but the discount ends tonight."

   (The mind hears: "ORDER RIGHT NOW before discount ends")

3. **"I'm not saying..."**
   "I'm not saying you should **INVEST YOUR ENTIRE BUDGET**, but this is the best ROI I've seen."

   (The mind hears: "INVEST because best ROI")

**Copywriting Application:**
```markdown
Sales Email:

"I'm not going to tell you to **DROP EVERYTHING AND WATCH THIS VIDEO**.

I'm not going to insist that you **CLEAR YOUR SCHEDULE FOR THE NEXT 47 MINUTES**.

And I definitely won't suggest you **GRAB A NOTEBOOK AND TAKE NOTES**.

But if you want to [desired outcome], you might want to do exactly that.

[CTA Button]"

(Every "don't" plants a command)
```

## Advanced Embedding Techniques

### Technique #8: Presuppositional Commands

**Structure:** The command is assumed as already true.

**Examples:**

1. **"Which..."**
   "Which payment method will you use to **INVEST IN YOURSELF**?"

   (Presupposes investment will happen; only asks "which payment")

2. **"How quickly..."**
   "How quickly will you **COMPLETE THE APPLICATION** after you see these results?"

   (Presupposes completion; only asks "how quickly")

**Copywriting Application:**
```markdown
Checkout Page:

"Which bonus would you like to receive when you **COMPLETE YOUR ORDER TODAY**?

□ Bonus A: Advanced Training ($297 value)
□ Bonus B: 1-on-1 Coaching Call ($497 value)
□ Both (Recommended)

After you **FINISH YOUR PURCHASE**, you'll get instant access to your selection."
```

---

### Technique #9: Stacked Commands

**How it works:** Embed multiple commands in one sentence.

**Example:**
"When you **CLICK THE BUTTON** and **ENTER YOUR EMAIL**, you'll **START RECEIVING** the strategies that helped me **EARN $10K/MONTH**."

**Commands identified:**
1. CLICK THE BUTTON
2. ENTER YOUR EMAIL
3. START RECEIVING
4. EARN $10K/MONTH (implied: you will too)

**Copywriting Application:**
```markdown
Landing Page CTA:

"When you **JOIN TODAY** and **COMPLETE MODULE 1**, you'll **DISCOVER THE METHOD** that 5,000 students used to **TRANSFORM THEIR LIVES** in just 30 days.

**START YOUR TRANSFORMATION** by clicking below."

(5 embedded commands in 2 sentences!)
```

---

### Technique #10: Embedded Questions

**How it works:** Hide commands inside questions.

**Examples:**

1. **Tag Questions:**
   "You want to succeed, don't you?"

   (Command: "WANT TO SUCCEED")

2. **Rhetorical Questions:**
   "Why wait to **START EARNING MORE**?"

   (Command: "START EARNING MORE now, don't wait")

3. **Leading Questions:**
   "Can you imagine what it's like to **WAKE UP DEBT-FREE**?"

   (Command: "WAKE UP DEBT-FREE" + visualize it)

**Copywriting Application:**
```markdown
Email Body:

"Can you imagine opening your phone and seeing **FIVE NEW CLIENTS** waiting in your inbox?

What would it feel like to **WORK JUST 4 HOURS A DAY** and earn more than your old 9-5?

How would your life change if you could **FIRE YOUR BOSS** next month?

These aren't fantasies. They're what happens when you **APPLY OUR SYSTEM**.

Ready to **START YOUR FREE TRIAL**?"

(7 embedded commands disguised as questions)
```

---

## The Command Sentence Formula

```
[Softener] + [Subject] + [Time Marker] + **COMMAND** + [Benefit]
```

**Example Breakdown:**

"**Many people find** (softener) that **when they** (time) **INVEST IN THIS COURSE** (command), **they get results in 7 days** (benefit)."

**More Examples:**

1. "You might notice that as you **READ THIS PAGE**, you start feeling more excited."

2. "Our customers tell us that after they **PLACE THEIR ORDER**, they feel relieved they finally did it."

3. "Most entrepreneurs discover that when they **JOIN OUR MASTERMIND**, their income doubles within 90 days."

## Ethical Guidelines for Embedded Commands

### ✅ DO:

1. **Use for mutual benefit**
   - Help people make decisions they'll be happy with
   - Guide toward genuine solutions

2. **Be congruent**
   - Only embed commands you'd state overtly
   - Ensure product delivers on promises

3. **Respect autonomy**
   - Commands should guide, not coerce
   - Always allow choice

4. **Test ethically**
   - Use on willing audiences
   - Measure real satisfaction (not just conversions)

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Manipulate the vulnerable**
   - No commands targeting addictions
   - No exploiting fear/desperation

2. **Contradict conscious claims**
   - If you say "no pressure," don't embed pressure commands
   - Be congruent between overt and covert messages

3. **Override better judgment**
   - Don't embed commands to ignore red flags
   - Don't command impulsive financial decisions

4. **Use without value**
   - Commands without delivering real value = manipulation
   - Must genuinely believe in what you're selling

## Common Mistakes & How to Fix

### Mistake #1: Too Obvious

❌ **Bad:**
"You will BUY THIS NOW and you will LOVE IT."

✅ **Good:**
"When you **try this risk-free**, you might find yourself wondering why you didn't **start sooner**."

**Fix:** Soften with time markers and awareness predicates.

---

### Mistake #2: Too Many Commands (Overload)

❌ **Bad:**
"When you **BUY NOW** and **CLICK HERE** and **ORDER TODAY** and **SIGN UP FAST**..."

✅ **Good:**
"When you **join our program**, you'll see why 5,000 members **upgraded their accounts** within 30 days."

**Fix:** 1-2 commands per sentence max. Space them out.

---

### Mistake #3: Incongruent Commands

❌ **Bad:**
"No pressure at all! But you should **BUY IMMEDIATELY BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT**!"

✅ **Good:**
"Take your time deciding. When you're ready to **move forward**, we'll be here."

**Fix:** Match embedded commands to overall tone.

---

### Mistake #4: Ignoring Context

❌ **Bad (wrong context):**
"When you **BUY THIS TREADMILL**, you'll lose 50 pounds."
(Context: reader just looking for info, not ready to buy)

✅ **Good:**
"As you **research treadmills**, you'll notice ours has 4.9 stars. When you're ready to **compare prices**, you'll see why we're the best value."

**Fix:** Match command intensity to buyer stage (awareness → consideration → decision).

---

### Mistake #5: No Follow-Through

❌ **Bad:**
Embed "CLICK HERE" command... but no clear CTA button.

✅ **Good:**
Embed "CLICK THE BUTTON BELOW" → immediately show button.

**Fix:** Embedded commands must have overt counterpart nearby.

---

## Advanced Strategy: The Command Sequence

For maximum persuasion, build a **command sequence** throughout your copy:

**Stage 1: Soft Commands (Build Rapport)**
- "You might notice..."
- "You'll discover..."
- "As you read..."

**Stage 2: Medium Commands (Generate Interest)**
- "When you try..."
- "You'll realize..."
- "Imagine what happens when you..."

**Stage 3: Strong Commands (Drive Action)**
- "Click the button below"
- "Join now"
- "Start your free trial"

**Example Flow (Email):**

```markdown
Subject: You'll notice something interesting...

Body:

You might notice as you **READ THIS EMAIL** that it feels different. (SOFT)

That's because when you **DISCOVER WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SHARE**, everything changes. (MEDIUM)

My mentor told me: "**INVEST IN THIS TRAINING** before the price goes up." (MEDIUM)

I did. Revenue tripled in 60 days.

Don't **CLICK THE LINK BELOW** unless you want the same results. (STRONG - negative)

[CTA: START YOUR TRANSFORMATION]

After you **COMPLETE YOUR ORDER**, you'll see why I'm so passionate about this. (STRONG - presupposed)
```

**Notice the progression:** Soft → Medium → Strong as trust builds.
