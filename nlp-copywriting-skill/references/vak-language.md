# VAK Language - Sensory Systems in Copywriting

## Overview

**VAK** = Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic

People process and represent information through three primary sensory channels. By matching their preferred system, you create instant rapport and deeper engagement.

**Key Insight:** When you use someone's sensory language, they unconsciously feel "This person gets me."

---

## The Three Representational Systems

### Distribution in Population:
- **Visual:** 55-60%
- **Auditory:** 20-25%
- **Kinesthetic:** 15-20%

**Implication for copywriting:** Use all three systems to reach everyone, but emphasize visual language since most people are visual processors.
