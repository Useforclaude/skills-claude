## Formula 1: PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution) + NLP

### Structure
1. **Problem** (Pacing + Mind Reading)
2. **Agitate** (Cause-Effect + Nominalizations)
3. **Solution** (Presuppositions + Embedded Commands)

### Template

**Headline:** [Pattern Interrupt + Presupposition]
```
"Stop [Doing X] (Before It [Negative Outcome])"
Example: "Stop Trying to Make Money (Before You Go Broke Trying)"
```

**Subheadline:** [Mind Reading + Pacing]
```
"You're [Current State], feeling [Emotion], and wondering [Question]..."
Example: "You're working 60-hour weeks, feeling exhausted, and wondering if there's a better way..."
```

**Problem Section:** [Pacing Current Experience 3x]
```
• You're [Observable Truth 1]
• You've tried [Observable Truth 2]
• You feel [Observable Truth 3]

Example:
• You're stuck in a job that drains you
• You've tried side hustles that went nowhere
• You feel trapped with no way out
```

**Agitate:** [Cause-Effect + Universal Quantifiers]
```
"This [Problem] causes [Pain], which leads to [Bigger Pain]. Everyone who [Stays in Problem] always ends up [Worst Outcome]."

Example:
"This cycle causes burnout, which leads to health problems and broken relationships. Everyone who stays stuck in the 9-5 grind always ends up regretting the years they wasted."
```

**Solution Intro:** [Reframe + Lost Performative]
```
"But here's what nobody tells you: [Reframe]. It's obvious that [New Perspective]."

```
"[Action] below to [Benefit]. Will you [Option A] or [Option B]? Either way, **TAKE ACTION NOW**."

Example:
"Click below to claim your spot. Will you start your transformation today or tomorrow? Either way, **SECURE YOUR FUTURE NOW**."
```

## Formula 2: AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action) + NLP

### Structure
1. **Attention** (Pattern Interrupt + Mind Reading)
2. **Interest** (Curiosity + Presuppositions)
3. **Desire** (Future Pacing + VAK)
4. **Action** (Embedded Commands + Urgency)

### Template

**Attention (Headline):** [Pattern Interrupt + Universal Quantifier]
```
"[Shocking Statement] That Everyone [Does/Believes] Is [Opposite of Expected]"

Example: "The 'Hard Work' Everyone Believes In Is Actually Keeping You Poor"
```

**Interest (Opening):** [Mind Reading + Embedded Question]
```
"You're probably wondering [Question]. I wondered that too, until I discovered [Insight]."

Example: "You're probably wondering how that's possible. I wondered that too, until I discovered the hidden trap built into the traditional work model."
```

**Interest Build:** [Story + Isomorphic Metaphor]
```
Tell brief story (2-3 paragraphs) where:
- Character = Reader proxy
- Problem = Reader's problem
- Discovery = Your solution

Example:
"I met a guy named Tom. 45, two kids, working 70-hour weeks. Sound familiar?

Tom believed hard work was the answer. Work harder, earn more. But the harder he worked, the less time he had. More money, but no life.

Then he discovered something that changed everything: leverage. Instead of working harder, he worked smarter. Instead of trading time for dollars, he built systems that worked for him."
```

**Desire:** [Future Pacing + Multi-Sensory Language]
```
"Imagine [Visual], feel [Kinesthetic], hear [Auditory]. Picture yourself [Future State]."

Example:
"Imagine waking up without an alarm (K). See the balance in your bank account growing while you sleep (V). Hear your family say 'We're so proud of you' (A). Picture yourself living the life you've always wanted but never thought possible (V)."
```

**Action (CTA):** [Embedded Commands + Temporal Presupposition]
```
"When you **[ACTION]** today, you'll [Immediate Benefit]. Before you [Future Benefit], you need to [ACTION] first."

```

2. **After** (Future Pacing + VAK)
3. **Bridge** (Your Solution with Presuppositions)

### Template

**Before (Current State):** [Pacing + Nominalizations]
```
"Right now, your [Situation] is characterized by [Nominalization 1], [Nominalization 2], and [Nominalization 3]."

Example:
"Right now, your financial situation is characterized by struggle, uncertainty, and frustration. Each month brings the same cycle: bills, stress, barely enough to get by."
```

**After (Desired State):** [Future Pacing + Multi-Sensory]
```
"Picture this: [Visual Future]. Feel [Kinesthetic Future]. Hear [Auditory Future]. This is your [Nominalization]."

Example:
"Picture this: checking your bank account and seeing abundance (V). Feel the security of knowing bills are paid automatically (K). Hear yourself confidently saying 'Money isn't a problem anymore' (A). This is your financial freedom."
```

**Bridge (How to Get There):** [Presuppositions + Cause-Effect]
```
"When you [Use Solution], this transformation happens because [Mechanism]. The [Solution] causes [Result], which leads to [Bigger Result]."

```

**Proof:** [Social Proof + Universal Quantifiers]
```
"Every person who [Took Action] has [Result]. All our [Number] clients report [Benefit]."

"Every person who committed to this system has seen positive cash flow within 60 days. All our 2,847 clients report feeling less stressed and more in control of their finances."
```

**CTA:** [Double Bind + Embedded Commands]
```
"You have two choices: [Stay in Before] or [Move to After]. When you **[ACTION]** below, you choose [After]."

1. **Features** (Specific facts)
2. **Advantages** (Cause-Effect)
3. **Benefits** (VAK + Emotional payoff)

### Template

**Headline:** [Benefit-Driven + Presupposition]
```
"When You [Benefit], [Additional Benefit], and [Ultimate Benefit]"

Example: "When You Automate Your Income, Free Your Time, and Finally Live the Life You Deserve"
```

```
"[System/Product] includes [Specific Feature]."

```

**CTA:** [Embedded Commands + Urgency]

```
"You've probably heard [Objection]. What [Number] successful clients discovered is [Reframe]."

Total value: $[Total]
Your investment today: $[Price]"
