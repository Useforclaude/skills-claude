# The 15 Core Objections - Deep Reference Guide

## Introduction

These 15 objections account for 95%+ of all sales resistance. Master these, and you can handle virtually any objection you'll encounter.

Each objection includes:
- What they really mean (psychology)
- 8-10 specific handling techniques
- Real-world examples
- When to use each approach
- Common mistakes to avoid

## Objection #1: "It's Too Expensive" / "I Can't Afford It"

### Psychological Truth

This objection is RARELY about money. It's about:
1. **Value Gap:** They don't see value exceeding price
2. **Risk Aversion:** Fear of wasting money
3. **Comparison Shopping:** Testing to see if you'll discount
4. **Budget Excuse:** Easier than saying "I don't want it"
5. **Authority Cover:** Can't admit they lack buying power

### Technique 1: The Isolation Question

**Script:**
```
"I appreciate you being upfront about that. Let me ask you something:
If price were not an issue, is this something you'd definitely want?"

IF YES: "Okay, so it's not really about whether you want it, but how to
make the investment work. Is that accurate?"

IF NO: "I understand. What else is holding you back besides the investment?"
```

**When to Use:** Early in objection handling to confirm it's real

**Why It Works:** Separates price from value, exposes smoke screens

### Technique 2: Cost Breakdown

**Script:**
```
"Let's break this down. You're looking at $12,000 per year. That's:
- $1,000 per month
- $250 per week
- $36 per day

For $36 a day—less than most people spend on lunch—you get [LIST VALUE].
Does that change how you see the investment?"
```

**When to Use:** When they need different perspective on numbers

**Why It Works:** Makes large numbers feel small and manageable

### Technique 3: ROI Calculator

**Script:**
```
"I get it. Let me show you something. What's your average customer worth?
[$500]. And how many customers do you get per month? [20].

Okay, so you're doing $10,000 a month. If this increased your customers by
just 20%—that's 4 more customers—you'd make an extra $2,000 per month.

Your investment is $1,000 per month. So you're net positive $1,000 every
month. Over a year, that's $12,000 profit AFTER the investment pays for
itself. Make sense?"
```

**When to Use:** With analytical buyers or B2B sales

**Why It Works:** Shows them their own numbers, hard to argue with math

### Technique 4: Cost of NOT Buying

**Script:**
```
"I understand the investment seems high. Let me ask you this: What's it
currently costing you NOT to have this solution?

You mentioned you're losing [X leads/sales/time] per month. That's costing
you [$ AMOUNT]. Over a year, that's [$BIGGER AMOUNT].

So the real question isn't whether you can afford this. It's whether you
can afford NOT to do this."
```

**When to Use:** When they're losing money/opportunity without your solution

**Why It Works:** Reframes from cost to opportunity cost

### Technique 5: Payment Plan

**Script:**
```
"What if I could break this into smaller payments? Instead of $10,000 upfront,
what if you paid $2,000 now and $2,000 per month for 4 months? Would that work
better with your cash flow?"
```

**When to Use:** When cash flow is the real concern

**Why It Works:** Removes barrier while maintaining full price

### Technique 6: Comparison to Alternatives

**Script:**
```
"What are you comparing this to? [They mention alternative]. Okay, let's
compare apples to apples:

Option A (them): $8,000, gives you [X, Y]
Option B (us): $12,000, gives you [X, Y, Z, A, B, C]

So you're getting 3x the value for 1.5x the price. Actually, we're the
better deal when you look at cost per result."
```

**When to Use:** When they're comparing to cheaper alternatives

**Why It Works:** Shows value per dollar, not just total price

### Technique 7: Social Proof Response

**Script:**
```
"I totally understand. [Similar client] said the same thing when they first
saw the investment. They were spending $5K with a competitor and wondered
why we cost $12K.

Here's what they found: With the competitor, they got [mediocre results].
With us, they got [5x better results]. Now they say it's the best money
they've ever spent. Want to see their case study?"
```

**When to Use:** When you have strong testimonials/case studies

**Why It Works:** Social proof from peers is powerful validator

### Technique 8: The Guarantee Response

**Script:**
```
"I hear you. That's exactly why we offer our guarantee: If you don't [get
specific result] in [timeframe], you get a full refund.

So really, the only way you waste money is if you DON'T try this and keep
losing [$ amount] every month. Your choice."
```

**When to Use:** When you have a strong guarantee

**Why It Works:** Removes risk, makes inaction riskier than action

### Technique 9: Premium Positioning

**Script:**
```
"You're right, we're not the cheapest. We're also not trying to be.

Here's what you pay for with us:
- [Unique benefit 1]
- [Unique benefit 2]
- [Unique benefit 3]

You can definitely find cheaper options. But can you find something that
delivers [key result] as reliably as we do? Because that's what you're
really paying for."
```

**When to Use:** When you're premium priced and proud of it

**Why It Works:** Reframes from price to value received

### Technique 10: The Budget Finding Questions

**Script:**
```
"Help me understand your budget situation. When you say you can't afford it,
do you mean:
A) You literally have zero budget for anything?
B) You haven't allocated budget for this specifically?
C) This costs more than you expected?

[They'll clarify, usually B or C]

"Okay, so it's not about having money, it's about [real issue]. Let's talk
about that..."
```

**When to Use:** To uncover what they really mean

**Why It Works:** Gets to truth, allows targeted response

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Dropping price immediately** - Shows you weren't priced fairly
2. **Getting defensive** - Makes them defensive too
3. **Apologizing for price** - Undermines value
4. **Ignoring the objection** - They'll keep bringing it up
5. **Not showing ROI** - They can't justify the expense

### When This Is Real

Sometimes they genuinely can't afford it. Signs:
- Startup with no revenue
- Personal financial crisis
- Company in financial trouble

**If real, either:**
- Offer payment plan
- Offer smaller package
- Put them in pipeline for later
- Disqualify gracefully

## Objection #2: "I Need to Think About It"

### Psychological Truth

This is almost NEVER about thinking. It's about:
1. **Lack of Urgency:** "I can decide anytime, so not now"
2. **Lack of Trust:** "I don't trust you/this yet"
3. **Lack of Value:** "I'm not convinced this is worth it"
4. **Decision Avoidance:** "I'm uncomfortable making decisions"
5. **Escape Hatch:** "I want to end this conversation politely"

### Technique 1: Get Specific

**Script:**
```
"I totally understand wanting to think it through. What specifically would
you like to think about? Is it the features, the investment, the timing,
or something else I haven't explained well?"

[They'll reveal the real concern, then address THAT]
```

**When to Use:** Always - first response to this objection

**Why It Works:** Uncovers real objection hiding behind "think about it"

### Technique 2: The Permission Pattern

**Script:**
```
"That's fair. Can I ask you something though? In my experience, when someone
says they need to think about it, it's usually because they're either:
A) Not sure it'll work for them
B) Not sure about the investment
C) Not sure about the timing
D) Something else I missed

Which is it for you? Because I'd rather address it now than have you waste
time thinking about something I could clarify in 2 minutes."
```

**When to Use:** When you want to be direct but respectful

**Why It Works:** Gives them "out" while getting to truth

### Technique 3: Future Pace

**Script:**
```
"Sure. Let me ask you this: When you think about it, what's going to change?
Will you suddenly have more money? More time? More information?

[Usually nothing]

"Right, so if you like it now, you'll like it in a week. And if you don't,
thinking about it won't change that. What's REALLY holding you back?"
```

**When to Use:** When you suspect it's a delay tactic

**Why It Works:** Shows thinking won't change anything

### Technique 4: The Timeline Question

**Script:**
```
"I respect that. How long do you need? A day? A week? A month?

[They give timeframe]

"Okay, and what specifically will you be thinking about during that time?"

[Listen]

"Got it. What if we addressed those questions right now? Would that help
you make a decision today?"
```

**When to Use:** To box them into commitment

**Why It Works:** Creates accountability and urgency

### Technique 5: The Cost of Delay

**Script:**
```
"Fair enough. Let's walk through what that looks like:

You think about it for 2 weeks, decide yes, we start implementation 3 weeks
from now. You get results in 6 weeks total.

OR

We start today, you get results in 3 weeks.

That's a 3-week difference. In those 3 weeks, you're losing [specific amount/
opportunity]. Is that worth it just to 'think about it'?"
```

**When to Use:** When there's tangible cost to waiting

**Why It Works:** Makes delay costly, creates urgency

### Technique 6: The Take-Away

**Script:**
```
"You know what, you're right. Maybe now isn't the right time. Let me ask you
this: What would need to change in your business for this to become a priority?

[They often talk themselves INTO it]

"Interesting. Because from what you described earlier, those things are already
true. So maybe the issue isn't timing—it's something else?"
```

**When to Use:** When nothing else works

**Why It Works:** Reverse psychology, removes pressure

### Technique 7: The Decision Matrix

**Script:**
```
"I get it. Let me help you think through this:

There are really only two decisions here:
1. Is this the right solution for your problem? Yes or No?
2. If yes, is now the right time? Yes or No?

Let's start with #1. Based on what you've seen, is this the right solution?"

[If yes, then] "Okay, so it's just about timing. Let's talk about that..."
```

**When to Use:** To break down the decision

**Why It Works:** Simplifies, gets commitments incrementally

### Technique 8: The Information Gambit

**Script:**
```
"Absolutely. What information would you need to make a confident decision?

[They list things]

"Okay, I can get you [item 1] and [item 2] right now. And [item 3] I can
have to you by end of day. If I get you all of that, would you be ready to
make a decision tomorrow?"

[Locks in timeline and commitment]
```

**When to Use:** With analytical buyers

**Why It Works:** Gives them what they need while maintaining momentum

### Technique 9: The Social Proof Story

**Script:**
```
"I understand. Sarah at TechCorp said the same thing. She thought about it
for 3 weeks. When she came back ready to start, she'd lost her best salesperson
to a competitor who was using our system.

She told me: 'I was so worried about making the wrong decision that I ended up
making the worst decision—no decision at all.'

I'm not saying you're in the same boat. But I am asking: What's really holding
you back?"
```

**When to Use:** When you have regret stories

**Why It Works:** Emotional impact of missed opportunity

### Technique 10: The Comparison Close

**Script:**
```
"Let me ask you something: Have you ever thought about buying something,
waited, and then regretted waiting? [Usually yes]. What happened?

[They tell story]

"Exactly. And have you ever made a decision quickly and regretted it? [Rarely].

See, analysis paralysis is more dangerous than decisive action. What does
your gut tell you about this?"
```

**When to Use:** With indecisive prospects

**Why It Works:** Appeals to past experience and intuition

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Accepting it at face value** - You'll lose the sale
2. **Pressuring them** - Creates resistance
3. **Not scheduling follow-up** - They'll ghost you
4. **Sending info without commitment** - Low conversion
5. **Not uncovering real objection** - Can't address it

### When to Walk Away

If after probing they're still non-committal, say:
```
"I respect that you need time. Here's my concern: I don't want to waste your
time or mine. Can you be straight with me—is this a 'I need to think' or is
this a polite 'no'? Because if it's a no, that's fine. I'd just rather know."
```

Often this honesty gets the truth and reopens the sale.

## Objection #3: "I Need to Talk to My [Partner/Boss/Team]"

### Psychological Truth

This means:
1. **Not the Decision Maker:** You're talking to wrong person
2. **Risk Avoidance:** Won't decide alone, needs validation
3. **Delay Tactic:** Using it as excuse to think
4. **Authority Issue:** Lacks confidence to decide
5. **Real Partner Buy-In:** Actually needs spouse/business partner

### Technique 1: Qualify Early (Prevention)

**Script:**
```
[At START of conversation]

"Before we dive in, let me ask: When you see something that could help [achieve
goal], are you able to move forward today, or are there other people involved
in the decision?"

[They'll tell you upfront]
```

**When to Use:** First 5 minutes of every sales conversation

**Why It Works:** Prevents wasted time, surfaces decision process early

### Technique 2: Get Them on the Call

**Script:**
```
"That makes total sense. I'd rather explain this once to both of you than have
you try to relay everything I said. Can you grab them real quick? Or can we
do a quick 3-way call right now?"

[If they resist]

"Here's why I ask: You might remember 80% of what we discussed, but that other
20% is usually what makes or breaks the decision. I'd hate for you to lose the
sale because of something you forgot to mention."
```

**When to Use:** When partner is available/nearby

**Why It Works:** Prevents broken telephone, increases close rate

### Technique 3: Trial Close First

**Script:**
```
"I understand. Let me ask you this first: If it were completely up to you,
is this something you'd want to do?"

IF NO: "Okay, so it sounds like you're not sold yet. Let's talk about that..."

IF YES: "Great! So the question is just how to get [partner] on board. What's
typically important to them when making decisions like this?"

[Now you know what to emphasize]
```

**When to Use:** Always, before dealing with partner objection

**Why It Works:** Qualifies if THEY want it, gives intel on partner

### Technique 4: Arm Them with Information

**Script:**
```
"No problem. Let's make sure you have everything you need to present this
properly. What questions is [partner] going to ask you?

[They list questions]

"Perfect. Let's go through each one so you can answer confidently. And I'll
send you a one-page summary that covers [what partner cares about]. Sound good?"

[Practice the pitch WITH them, make them your internal champion]
```

**When to Use:** When you can't get to the decision maker

**Why It Works:** Makes them your salesperson

### Technique 5: Schedule Joint Call

**Script:**
```
"Totally understand. Here's what works best: Let me send you a quick summary
via email that you can forward to [partner]. Then let's schedule a 15-minute
call with both of you—maybe tomorrow or Wednesday?

That way [partner] can ask questions directly, you don't have to remember
everything, and we can make a decision together. What works better for you,
morning or afternoon?"

[Book it NOW]
```

**When to Use:** With B2B or couples

**Why It Works:** Maintains momentum, gets decision maker involved

### Technique 6: Authority Questions

**Script:**
```
"I appreciate you being upfront about that. Help me understand the decision
process. When [partner] hears about this, what's their typical reaction? Are
they usually supportive of investments like this, or do they tend to be more
conservative?"

[Understand the dynamic]

"And in the past, when you've brought them something you were excited about,
what made them say yes?"

[Now you know how to position it]
```

**When to Use:** To understand power dynamics

**Why It Works:** Gives you strategy for winning partner over

### Technique 7: Role-Based Social Proof

**Script:**
```
"Makes sense. When I worked with [Similar Company], the [same role as partner]
initially had concerns about [common concern]. What convinced them was [specific
thing].

In your case, [partner] is probably going to wonder about [anticipated concern].
Here's how I'd suggest presenting that..."

[Coach them on handling partner's likely objections]
```

**When to Use:** When you know partner's typical concerns

**Why It Works:** Pre-handles partner objections

### Technique 8: The Business Case

**Script:**
```
"Smart to involve [partner]. Let's build the business case together. What does
[partner] care about most: ROI, risk, implementation, or something else?

[They tell you]

"Perfect. Here's what we'll do: I'll create a one-page ROI breakdown showing
[what partner cares about]. You can present it, and I'll be available for a
quick call to answer any technical questions. When can you talk to them?"

[Get timeline commitment]
```

**When to Use:** With financial decision makers

**Why It Works:** Professional approach, hard to say no to data

### Technique 9: The Test Close

**Script:**
```
"Before you talk to [partner], let me ask: Are YOU convinced this is the right
move? Because if you're not 100% sold, [partner] definitely won't be.

[If they're not convinced, handle their objections first]

[If they are] "Great. So you just need [partner] on board. Here's the thing:
Your conviction matters more than my pitch. When you believe in it, they'll
feel that. What would make you feel 100% confident presenting this?"
```

**When to Use:** To check their commitment level

**Why It Works:** Can't sell through skeptical messenger

### Technique 10: The Decision Timeline

**Script:**
```
"I get it. When will you talk to them? [Date]. And when do they typically
make decisions—right away or do they need to think too? [Answer].

Okay, so best case scenario, we're looking at starting on [future date].
Between now and then, you're losing [specific opportunity/cost].

What if we did this: Lock in your spot now with [deposit/small commitment],
then if [partner] says no, we refund you immediately. At least you don't lose
your place in line. Make sense?"
```

**When to Use:** When timing matters (scarcity)

**Why It Works:** Preserves urgency, gets micro-commitment

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not qualifying decision maker early** - Waste entire pitch
2. **Pitching to non-decision maker** - Broken telephone
3. **Accepting "I'll tell them" at face value** - Low close rate
4. **Not scheduling joint call** - Lose momentum
5. **Not making them internal champion** - They won't sell for you

### Red Flags

Watch for:
- "I make all the decisions" but then later "I need to talk to partner"
  → They lied, trust issue

- "They'll definitely say yes" but won't get them on call
  → They're not confident, or partner doesn't exist

- Multiple layers of approval
  → Deal is too complex, qualify budget/authority better

## Objection #4: "Just Send Me Some Information"

### Psychological Truth

This is rarely about information. It means:
1. **Polite Escape:** "I want to end this conversation"
2. **Not Interested:** "No, but I don't want to say it"
3. **Deflection:** "I'm not ready to engage yet"
4. **Procrastination:** "Let me think without you"
5. **Email Black Hole:** "I'll ghost you via email"

### Technique 1: The Specificity Question

**Script:**
```
"I'd be happy to send you information. What specifically would you like to know
about? Is it how the system works, pricing, case studies, implementation, or
something else?"

[Forces them to engage, reveals real interest level]

"Okay, great. Rather than sending you a generic packet, let me ask you a few
questions so I send exactly what you need..."

[Now you're back in conversation]
```

**When to Use:** Always - first response

**Why It Works:** Reveals if they're genuinely interested or deflecting

### Technique 2: The Honesty Card

**Script:**
```
"I can definitely send you information. But can I be totally honest with you?
In my experience, when people ask for information, one of two things happens:

1. They never read it and I never hear from them again
2. They read it, have questions, and we end up on a call anyway

Which one sounds like you?

[They'll usually laugh and admit it]

"Right. So can we just save some time and address your questions now?"
```

**When to Use:** When rapport is good

**Why It Works:** Disarms with honesty, gets real conversation

### Technique 3: The Pre-Frame

**Script:**
```
"Absolutely. Before I do, let me ask: Have you ever requested information from
a company, they sent you a 20-page PDF, and you actually read it?

[Usually no]

"Exactly. Information without context is useless. What I'd rather do is take
5 minutes to walk you through the key points so you know what to look for.
Then I'll send you the detailed backup. Sound fair?"

[Now you're presenting]
```

**When to Use:** To prevent email black hole

**Why It Works:** Shows you understand their time, gets permission to pitch

### Technique 4: The Commitment Trade

**Script:**
```
"I'll absolutely send you information. In exchange, can you do me a favor?
Let's schedule 15 minutes tomorrow to discuss your thoughts. That way I know
you actually got it and didn't just end up in your spam folder.

Does 10am or 2pm work better?"

[Book the follow-up NOW]
```

**When to Use:** When you can't present now but want commitment

**Why It Works:** Information + scheduled follow-up = higher conversion

### Technique 5: The Qualification First

**Script:**
```
"Sure thing. Before I send you stuff, let me ask a couple quick questions so
I don't waste your time:

1. Are you actually looking for a solution to [problem] or just exploring?
2. If you found the right solution, what's your timeline to implement?
3. What would make this a no-brainer for you?

[Based on answers, qualify if worth pursuing]
```

**When to Use:** To avoid wasting time on tire-kickers

**Why It Works:** Separates real prospects from browsers

### Technique 6: The Customization Offer

**Script:**
```
"I'd rather not send you generic information. Here's what I'd like to do:

Based on what you've told me about [their situation], I'll put together a
customized one-page breakdown showing:
- How this specifically helps [their problem]
- Expected timeline and implementation
- Pricing for [their use case]
- Next steps if you want to move forward

To do that, I just need to understand [a few more things]..."

[Get them answering questions, re-engage]
```

**When to Use:** With qualified prospects

**Why It Works:** Shows you're not mass-marketing, requires their input

### Technique 7: The Scarcity Response

**Script:**
```
"I can send you information, but here's what I need you to know: We're currently
[running a promotion/limited to X clients/booking out] until [date].

So if after reviewing the info you decide you want to move forward, you'll
want to let me know by [deadline] to lock in [benefit].

Otherwise, we're looking at [later date/higher price/no availability]. Make
sense?

Now, what specific questions do you have that I can address in the material?"
```

**When to Use:** When you have legitimate urgency

**Why It Works:** Creates deadline for response

### Technique 8: The Content Offer

**Script:**
```
"Instead of just generic info, can I send you something actually useful?

We created a [guide/checklist/calculator] on [relevant topic] that our clients
love. It'll help you [specific benefit] whether you work with us or not.

I'll include that plus a one-page overview of how we specifically help [their
situation]. Sound good?

Real quick though—what's your biggest challenge with [problem] right now?"

[Get one more answer, maintain engagement]
```

**When to Use:** With early-stage prospects

**Why It Works:** Provides value, builds goodwill, maintains contact

### Technique 9: The Direct Approach

**Script:**
```
"I appreciate you being polite, but let me ask you straight: Is this actually
something you're interested in, or is this your way of saying 'no thanks'?

Because if it's not a fit, that's totally fine—I'd just rather know now than
send you stuff you'll never read. No hard feelings either way.

But if you ARE interested and just want to review things on your own time,
I get that too. Just tell me which it is?"
```

**When to Use:** When you have strong rapport or nothing to lose

**Why It Works:** Honesty is disarming, gets truth

### Technique 10: The Video Alternative

**Script:**
```
"I'll do you one better than sending information. I'll send you a 3-minute
video that shows exactly how this works for companies like yours.

It's way easier than reading a PDF, and you can watch it whenever. Sound good?

While I'm making it though, what's the one thing you'd definitely want me to
cover?"

[Now they're invested in the content]
```

**When to Use:** When you can create quick personalized videos

**Why It Works:** Video has higher engagement than email, shows effort

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Sending info immediately** - No follow-up leverage
2. **Generic marketing materials** - Goes unread
3. **No follow-up scheduled** - They'll ghost you
4. **Taking "send info" at face value** - Missing real objection
5. **Sending too much** - Overwhelms, doesn't get read

### The Follow-Up Sequence

If you DO send information:

**Day 0:** Send customized info + book follow-up call
**Day 1:** "Did you get a chance to review [specific section]?"
**Day 3:** "I noticed you opened the email. Questions on [topic]?"
**Day 7:** "Most people find [specific insight] surprising. Thoughts?"
**Day 14:** Final follow-up with deadline/scarcity

### When to Actually Send Info

Send information when:
- They're qualified and genuinely need time
- Decision maker wants to review before call
- Complex sale requiring committee approval
- You're nurturing long-term relationship

Otherwise, close on the call.

## Objection #5: "I'm Already Working with Someone Else"

### Psychological Truth

This means:
1. **Loyalty Test:** "Give me a reason to switch"
2. **Satisfaction Check:** "I'm not thrilled but not desperate"
3. **Risk Aversion:** "Known mediocre beats unknown great"
4. **Laziness:** "Switching sounds like work"
5. **Contract Lock:** Actually can't switch yet

### Technique 1: The Respect Play

**Script:**
```
"That's great—I actually respect loyalty. Most people jump ship at the first
shiny object. Out of curiosity, what do you like most about working with them?"

[LISTEN carefully]

"That's awesome. And if you could wave a magic wand and change ONE thing about
the relationship, what would it be?"

[They reveal the gap—now you know what to offer]
```

**When to Use:** Always - shows respect, uncovers dissatisfaction

**Why It Works:** Non-threatening, gets them to voice problems

### Technique 2: The Comparison Questions

**Script:**
```
"No problem at all. Can I ask—are you getting [specific unique result] with
them?

[Usually no]

"Interesting. That's specifically what we specialize in. If you could add that
to what you're already getting, would that be valuable?"

[Position as supplement, not replacement]
```

**When to Use:** When you have clear differentiator

**Why It Works:** Not asking them to leave, just add

### Technique 3: The Addition Frame

**Script:**
```
"Perfect. I'm not suggesting you fire them. What I'm saying is use us for
[specific use case] where we excel, and keep them for [what they do well].

Think of it like having multiple tools in your toolbox. You don't throw away
your hammer just because you got a screwdriver, right?

Want to see how [client] uses us alongside [competitor] for exactly this?"
```

**When to Use:** When you can genuinely complement

**Why It Works:** Low-risk way to get in the door

### Technique 4: The Testing Frame

**Script:**
```
"I totally understand loyalty. Here's all I'm asking: Give us one project—
something relatively low-risk—and let us prove ourselves.

If we don't blow you away, you've lost maybe [small time/money]. But if we
DO outperform, you've just found a valuable resource. And you still keep your
current relationship as backup.

Fair enough?"
```

**When to Use:** For project-based work

**Why It Works:** Low commitment, competitive framing

### Technique 5: The Switching Cost Analysis

**Script:**
```
"I get it. Switching feels like a pain. Let me ask you this: How much time
would it really take to switch?

[They estimate, usually inflated]

"Okay, so let's say it's [X hours]. And with us, you'd get [Y result]. So
even accounting for [X hours] of transition time, you'd be net positive by
[soon]. Make sense?

Plus, we handle [90% of the migration], so your time investment is really
more like [smaller number]."
```

**When to Use:** When switching cost is the barrier

**Why It Works:** Shows switching cost is lower than they think

### Technique 6: The Performance Comparison

**Script:**
```
"That's fine. Can I ask—what kind of results are you getting with them?

[They share metrics]

"Okay. Our average client in [their industry] sees [better metrics]. If I
could guarantee you'd get at least [X% better than current], would that be
worth exploring?"

[If yes, show how]
```

**When to Use:** When you can beat their results

**Why It Works:** Data-driven, hard to argue with better performance

### Technique 7: Social Proof from Switchers

**Script:**
```
"I completely understand. [Company X], [Company Y], and [Company Z] all said
the same thing. They were working with [competitor] for years.

Then they tested us on one campaign. When they saw [specific result], they
moved everything over. Now they wish they'd switched sooner.

Want to hear what specifically made them switch?"

[Tell switching story]
```

**When to Use:** When you have strong switching testimonials

**Why It Works:** Peer proof is powerful, shows you've done this before

### Technique 8: The Backup Position

**Script:**
```
"No problem. Keep working with them. I just want to be your backup.

Here's why: What happens if they drop the ball? Raise prices? Go out of
business? You're stuck scrambling.

What if you just keep us in your back pocket? We'll stay in touch, and if
you ever need us, we're ready. Plus, just knowing you have an alternative
keeps [current provider] honest.

Make sense?"

[Stay in touch for when relationship fails]
```

**When to Use:** Long-term relationship building

**Why It Works:** No pressure, positions for future opportunity

### Technique 9: The Honest Audit

**Script:**
```
"I respect that. Let me propose something: Let us do a free audit of what
you're currently getting.

We'll look at [relevant metrics], compare them to industry benchmarks, and
show you where you're winning and where there might be gaps.

If we find you're already getting best-in-class results, I'll tell you to
keep doing what you're doing. But if we find opportunities, at least you'll
know. No obligation. Sound fair?"
```

**When to Use:** When you can provide genuine value in audit

**Why It Works:** Low-commitment, value-first approach

### Technique 10: The Contract Question

**Script:**
```
"Got it. Are you under contract with them, or is it month-to-month?

[If contract] "When does it renew? [Date]. Okay, let's put [date minus 60 days]
on the calendar to revisit this. That gives you time to evaluate alternatives
before you're locked in another year. Fair?"

[If month-to-month] "So you're not locked in. Out of curiosity, if they're
not under contract, what keeps you with them—great results, or just haven't
found something better?"

[Usually reveals dissatisfaction]
```

**When to Use:** To understand constraints and timing

**Why It Works:** Strategic timing for decision

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Badmouthing competitor** - Makes you look desperate/unprofessional
2. **Giving up immediately** - Existing relationship doesn't mean satisfaction
3. **Not offering test/trial** - All-or-nothing is hard sell
4. **Not uncovering dissatisfaction** - Can't position against it
5. **Pushing too hard** - Reinforces loyalty to current provider

### Key Insights

- 60% of "happy" clients would switch for 10% better results
- Most people overestimate switching cost by 3-5x
- Loyalty is often laziness in disguise
- Having backup option is valuable even if they don't switch
- Best time to win them is at contract renewal
