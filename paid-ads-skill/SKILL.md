## 🎯 Paid Ads Fundamentals

### Key Metrics

**Impressions:** How many times ad shown
**Clicks:** How many clicked
**CTR (Click-Through Rate):** Clicks / Impressions × 100%
**CPC (Cost Per Click):** Total Spend / Clicks
**CPM (Cost Per Mille):** Cost per 1,000 impressions
**Conversions:** Desired actions (purchase, signup)
**CVR (Conversion Rate):** Conversions / Clicks × 100%
**CPA (Cost Per Acquisition):** Total Spend / Conversions
**ROAS (Return on Ad Spend):** Revenue / Ad Spend

---

### ROAS Calculation

```
Campaign Performance:
- Ad Spend:    $1,000
- Revenue:     $5,000

ROAS = $5,000 / $1,000 = 5x

Interpretation: For every $1 spent, earned $5 back
```

**ROAS Benchmarks:**
```
ROAS < 1x  = Losing money
ROAS = 2x  = Breaking even (after COGS)
ROAS = 3x  = Profitable
ROAS > 5x  = Excellent
```

---

### Campaign Structure

```
