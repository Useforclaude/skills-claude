Results: 30-40% of new users from integration partnerships
```

**Best For:** SaaS, APIs, ecosystems

## üéØ Finding the Right Partners

### Partner Fit Criteria

**1. Complementary (Not Competitive)**
```
‚úÖ Good Fit:
- CRM (HubSpot) + Email marketing (Mailchimp)
- Accounting (QuickBooks) + Payroll (Gusto)
- E-commerce (Shopify) + Shipping (ShipStation)

‚ùå Bad Fit:
- CRM + CRM (direct competitors)
- Email tool + Email tool (no value for users)
```

**2. Shared Audience**
```
Check:
- Do they serve same customer profile?
- Similar company size/industry?
- Overlapping pain points?

Example:
Canva (design) + Buffer (social media)
‚Üí Same audience: Social media managers, small businesses
‚Üí Perfect fit!
```

**3. Brand Alignment**
```
Ask:
- Do our brands share similar values?
- Similar price points/positioning?
- Would our customers trust each other?

Example:
Luxury brand + Budget brand = Brand conflict
Eco-friendly + Fast fashion = Values conflict
```

## üìù Partnership Agreements

### Key Terms to Define

**1. Scope of Partnership**
```
Define:
- What are we doing together? (co-marketing, integration, resale?)
- Deliverables for each side
- Timeline (6 months, 1 year, ongoing?)

Example:
"Company A will create co-branded content (1 webinar, 2 blog posts). Company B will promote to their email list (50K subscribers). Duration: 3 months."
```

**2. Revenue/Lead Sharing**
```
Options:
- Revenue share (50/50 split of sales)
- Lead attribution (each keeps leads they generate)
- Referral commission (20% for referrals)
- No money exchanged (pure co-marketing)

Example:
"Each company keeps 100% of customers they directly acquire. Referrals earn 20% commission for 12 months."
```

**3. Exclusivity Clause**
```
Questions:
- Can we partner with competitors simultaneously?
- How long is exclusivity (if any)?
- What happens if we breach exclusivity?

Example:
"Company A agrees not to partner with [Competitor X, Y] for 12 months. After 12 months, exclusivity expires."
```

**4. Brand Usage**
```
Define:
- Can we use each other's logos/brands?
- Where (website, ads, press releases)?
- Approval required? (yes/no)

Example:
"Both companies may use partner logo on website and co-branded materials. Pre-approval required for press releases."
```

**5. Termination Clause**
```
Specify:
- How can either party exit? (30-day notice)
- What happens to ongoing campaigns?
- Who owns leads/data generated?

Example:
"Either party may terminate with 30 days written notice. All leads generated up to termination date remain with acquiring party."
```

## üö´ Partnership Pitfalls to Avoid

**1. Unequal Effort**
```

```

**2. Misaligned Incentives**
```
Problem: Goals don't align

Example:
- You want brand awareness
- Partner wants direct sales
- Campaigns fail (different metrics)

Solution: Agree on shared goal before starting
```

**3. No Clear Owner**
```
Problem: "Partnership" but no one owns it

Example:
- No dedicated point person
- Campaigns fall through cracks
- Partnership dies

Solution: Assign partnership manager on both sides
```
