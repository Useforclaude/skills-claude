# Personal Brand Content Strategy

## Strategic Content Framework for Personal Brands

### Content Pillars System

**What are content pillars?**
Core themes you consistently create content about that:
- Align with your expertise
- Serve your audience's needs
- Differentiate your brand
- Support your business goals

**The 3-5 Pillar Rule:**
- Choose 3-5 main topics
- Each pillar = 20-30% of content
- Rotate through pillars
- Allows depth + variety

**Example (Marketing Consultant):**
1. **SEO Strategies** (30%)
2. **Content Marketing** (25%)
3. **Personal Branding** (20%)
4. **Business Growth** (15%)
5. **Behind-the-Scenes** (10%)

**Example (Executive Coach):**
1. **Leadership Skills** (35%)
2. **Career Advancement** (25%)
3. **Communication** (20%)
4. **Personal Stories** (10%)
5. **Industry Insights** (10%)

### Choosing Your Content Pillars

**Framework:**

**Pillar 1: Core Expertise**
- Your main skill/service
- What you're known for
- Highest value content

**Pillar 2-3: Adjacent Expertise**
- Related topics
- Complementary skills
- Still relevant to audience

**Pillar 4: Personal/Lifestyle**
- Behind-the-scenes
- Your journey/story
- Humanizes your brand

**Pillar 5 (Optional): Industry Trends**
- News and commentary
- Thought leadership
- Positions you as informed

**Validation questions:**
1. Can I create 100+ pieces of content on this?
2. Does my audience care about this?
3. Does this differentiate me?
4. Does it align with my goals?

## Content Repurposing Playbook

### One Piece → 20+ Pieces

**Example: YouTube Video**

**From one 15-minute video:**
1. YouTube video (original)
2. Podcast episode (audio extract)
3. Blog post (transcript + editing)
4. Newsletter (summary + insights)
5-9. Twitter thread (5 key points)
10-14. LinkedIn posts (one insight each)
15-19. Instagram carousel (quotes)
20-24. TikTok clips (5x 60-second segments)
25. Infographic (key data)
26. Email sequence (teach over 5 days)
27-30. Quote graphics (social media)

**The Pyramid Repurposing:**
```
        Long-form (1 piece)
             ↓
     Medium-form (3-5 pieces)
             ↓
      Short-form (10-20 pieces)
             ↓
     Micro-content (30-50 pieces)
```

**Example pyramid:**
- YouTube video (20 min)
  → 3 blog posts
    → 10 Twitter threads
      → 30 quote graphics

## Content Ethics & Authenticity

### The Authenticity Balance

**Be authentic, but strategic:**
- Share real experiences (not fabricated)
- Show vulnerability (builds connection)
- But maintain boundaries (privacy)
- Not everything needs to be public

**What to share:**
✅ Lessons from failures
✅ Behind-the-scenes work
✅ Genuine opinions
✅ Real struggles (you've overcome)
✅ Authentic personality

**What to keep private:**
❌ Other people's private info
❌ Currently ongoing crises
❌ Information that harms others
❌ Violates NDAs/confidentiality
❌ Pure venting (without lesson)

### Giving Credit

**Always credit:**
- Original ideas (if not yours)
- Quotes and statistics
- Frameworks you learned
- Collaborators and team
- Inspirations

**How to credit:**
- "Learned this from @username"
- "Inspired by [person]'s work"
- "Credit to [source]"
- Link to original
- Tag appropriately

### AI-Generated Content

**Ethical AI use:**
✅ Ideation and brainstorming
✅ Drafts you heavily edit
✅ Research and summaries
✅ Repurposing assistance
✅ Disclosed when used

❌ Copy-paste AI output
❌ Pretending it's original
❌ No editing/personal touch
❌ Fake expertise

**Best practice:**
- Use AI as assistant, not ghostwriter
- Always add personal insights
- Edit heavily
- Fact-check everything
- Disclose if asked
