## Advanced: Principle Stacking

**Master persuaders stack multiple principles:**

Example of high-scoring copy structure:
```markdown
[HEADLINE]
→ Social Proof + Specificity + Curiosity Gap

[OPENING]
→ Pathos (pain) + Empathy + Specificity

[CREDIBILITY]
→ Ethos (demonstrated expertise) + Authority + Vulnerable Authority

[SOLUTION]
→ Logos (how it works) + Specificity + Proof Stack

[PROOF]
→ Social Proof (testimonials) + Specificity + Visual Proof

[OFFER]
→ Value Stack + Risk Reversal + Scarcity (legitimate)

[CLOSE]
→ Unity + Call-to-Action + Pathos (future state)
```

Each section hits multiple principles simultaneously.

## Final Pre-Publish Questions

1. **Would I send this to someone I care about?**
   - If no, why not? Fix that.

2. **Does this genuinely help the target audience?**
   - If unsure, don't publish.

3. **Am I proud of this work?**
   - If no, keep improving.

4. **Would I want to see this if I were the target audience?**
   - If no, it won't resonate.

5. **Is every claim defensible?**
   - If no, remove or prove it.
