# Aristotle's Rhetoric: The 3 Pillars of Persuasion

## Introduction

Over 2,300 years ago, Aristotle systematized the art of persuasion in his work "Rhetoric." His framework of Ethos, Pathos, and Logos remains the foundational model for persuasive communication today. These three modes of persuasion represent different pathways to influence:

- **Ethos:** Persuasion through character and credibility
- **Pathos:** Persuasion through emotion
- **Logos:** Persuasion through logic and reason

Aristotle argued that effective persuasion requires all three elements working together, adapted to the audience and context.

## Ethos: The Persuasion of Character

### Definition

**Ethos** is persuasion through the credibility, authority, and character of the speaker. It answers the question: "Why should I trust you?"

### Three Components of Ethos

#### 1. Phronesis (Practical Wisdom/Good Sense)

**Definition:** Demonstrated sound judgment and expertise.

**How to Establish:**
```
- Show relevant experience
- Demonstrate deep understanding of subject
- Make nuanced, thoughtful arguments
- Acknowledge complexity
- Show you've considered alternatives
```

**Example:**
```
"In my 20 years analyzing market trends across 4 economic cycles, I've learned
that [insight]. However, every situation has unique factors, which is why I'd
like to understand your specific circumstances before making a recommendation."

[Demonstrates: Experience + Nuance + Sound judgment]
```

#### 2. Arete (Virtue/Moral Character)

**Definition:** Demonstration of good character and ethical values.

**How to Establish:**
```
- Act with integrity
- Be honest even when inconvenient
- Show consistency between words and actions
- Demonstrate fairness
- Respect others
```

**Example:**
```
"I need to tell you something that might cost me this sale: Based on what you've
shared, our premium package isn't right for you. The mid-tier option would serve
you better and save you $50K. Here's why..."

[Demonstrates: Honesty + Client interest over self-interest + Integrity]
```

#### 3. Eunoia (Goodwill/Benevolence)

**Definition:** Showing genuine care for the audience's interests.

**How to Establish:**
```
- Listen actively to understand their needs
- Put their interests first
- Demonstrate empathy
- Tailor message to benefit them
- Show you're on their side
```

**Example:**
```
"I've been thinking about the challenge you mentioned regarding team adoption.
Before our next meeting, I pulled together 3 change management strategies that
worked for other clients in similar situations. I'd like to share these with you
- no strings attached - because I want you to succeed regardless of whether you
work with us."

[Demonstrates: Genuine care + Effort on their behalf + Generosity]
```

### Building Ethos: Practical Strategies

#### Before You Speak

**Research Your Audience:**
```
- What do they value?
- What are their concerns?
- Who do they already trust?
- What expertise do they respect?
```

**Prepare Your Credentials:**
```
Not just résumé facts, but:
- Relevant experience to THIS topic
- Track record with similar challenges
- Credentials that matter to THIS audience
```

**Anticipate Skepticism:**
```
- What doubts might they have about me?
- How can I address these proactively?
- What common ground can I establish?
```

#### As You Speak

**Demonstrate Expertise Without Arrogance:**
```
✅ "In my experience across 100+ implementations, the pattern I see is..."
❌ "I know more about this than anyone else..."

✅ "Research consistently shows... let me walk you through the evidence..."
❌ "Trust me, I'm the expert..."

✅ "I've made this mistake myself early in my career..."
❌ "Only an idiot would approach it that way..."
```

**Show Respect for Audience:**
```
✅ "You raise an excellent point..."
✅ "Help me understand your thinking on..."
✅ "I can see why you'd approach it that way..."
❌ "You're wrong because..."
❌ "Obviously..."
❌ "Let me educate you..."
```

**Acknowledge Limitations:**
```
"I'm not an expert in [adjacent field], but what I can speak to is..."
"That's outside my direct experience, but here's what the research shows..."
"I don't have all the answers, but I can share what's worked in similar situations..."
```

**Be Transparent:**
```
"My goal here is [honest statement of intent]"
"I should disclose that [potential conflict of interest]"
"In fairness, there are limitations to this approach: [limitations]"
```

### Ethos in Different Contexts

#### Academic/Scientific
```
Key Elements:
- Institutional affiliation
- Publications and citations
- Research methodology rigor
- Peer recognition
- Transparent about limitations and uncertainties
```

#### Business/Professional
```
Key Elements:
- Track record of results
- Client/customer success stories
- Industry recognition
- Thought leadership
- Professional network and endorsements
```

#### Political/Social
```
Key Elements:
- Consistency over time
- Alignment of actions and values
- Service and sacrifice
- Connection to community
- Moral leadership
```

### Destroying Ethos (What to Avoid)

**Actions That Undermine Ethos:**
- Lying or misleading
- Hypocrisy (saying one thing, doing another)
- Self-dealing without disclosure
- Attacking opponents personally
- Ignoring legitimate criticisms
- Claiming expertise you lack
- Cutting corners or unethical behavior

**Recovery from Damaged Ethos:**
```
1. Acknowledge the problem directly
2. Take responsibility (no excuses)
3. Explain what went wrong
4. Show what you've learned
5. Demonstrate change through actions
6. Rebuild trust slowly over time
```

## Pathos: The Persuasion of Emotion

### Definition

**Pathos** is persuasion through emotional appeal. It answers the question: "How should I feel about this?"

Aristotle recognized that humans are not purely rational - emotions significantly influence judgment and decision-making.

### The Emotions of Rhetoric

Aristotle catalogued key emotions in persuasion:

#### 1. Anger (Orgē)
**When to Evoke:**
- Highlighting injustice
- Motivating action against wrongdoing
- Channeling frustration toward solution

**How to Evoke:**
- Show unfair treatment
- Identify clear villain/cause
- Demonstrate harm to innocent
- Provide righteous outlet

**Example:**
```
"For three years, you've paid for a service that consistently fails. Your team works
late every Friday fixing problems that shouldn't exist. Meanwhile, the vendor raises
prices annually while cutting support. That's not acceptable, and you deserve better."

[Then offer solution that channels anger constructively]
```

#### 2. Calmness (Praotēs)
**When to Evoke:**
- Reducing overreaction
- Countering fear or anger
- Enabling rational consideration

**How to Evoke:**
- Provide reassurance
- Show control and stability
- Normalize concerns
- Offer clear path forward

**Example:**
```
"I understand the concern about switching systems. Change is always somewhat
unsettling. But let's look at what we know: we have a proven methodology, 300
successful transitions, and a rollback plan if needed. You're in control every
step of the way."
```

#### 3. Fear (Phobos)
**When to Evoke:**
- Highlighting genuine risks
- Creating urgency for action
- Motivating risk mitigation

**How to Evoke:**
- Vivid description of negative outcome
- Make threat feel immediate and relevant
- Show vulnerability
- BUT ALWAYS: Provide clear solution

**Example:**
```
"Here's what keeps me up at night for companies in your situation: A single data breach
could cost $4M in fines, destroy customer trust built over decades, and trigger lawsuits.
I saw this happen to a company very similar to yours last year - they're still recovering.

[Evoke fear]

The good news: This is completely preventable. Here's how..."

[Provide relief and solution]
```

**Critical Rule:** Never evoke fear without offering hope and solution.

#### 4. Confidence (Tharsos)
**When to Evoke:**
- Encouraging action
- Overcoming hesitation
- Building momentum

**How to Evoke:**
- Show others' success
- Demonstrate capability
- Reduce perceived risk
- Celebrate small wins

**Example:**
```
"You've already accomplished the hard part - getting buy-in from leadership.
Implementation is straightforward: 87% of our clients complete it in under 60 days
with no major issues. You have the team, the budget, and the executive support.
You're set up to succeed."
```

#### 5. Shame (Aischynē)
**When to Evoke (Carefully):**
- Highlighting inconsistency with values
- Motivating alignment with ideals
- Social pressure for positive behavior

**How to Evoke:**
- Point out gap between values and actions
- Reference standards/expectations
- Imply others notice the gap

**Example:**
```
"Your company's mission statement emphasizes innovation and employee development.
Yet your training budget hasn't increased in 5 years while competitors invest heavily.
Your best people are noticing."

[Implies: You're not living up to stated values]
```

**Warning:** Easily becomes manipulation. Use sparingly and only when pointing to genuine inconsistency.

#### 6. Pity/Compassion (Eleos)
**When to Evoke:**
- Charitable appeals
- Highlighting suffering
- Motivating helping behavior

**How to Evoke:**
- Tell specific stories (not just statistics)
- Show undeserved suffering
- Make victim relatable
- Demonstrate how they can help

**Example:**
```
"Sarah is a 7-year-old who loves soccer and drawing. She wakes up every day excited
about school. But she'll go to bed hungry tonight because her single mother, working
two jobs, still can't afford consistent meals. Your $50 donation provides a month
of nutritious breakfasts for Sarah."

[Specific person + Innocent + Relatable + Clear action]
```

#### 7. Indignation (Nemesis)
**When to Evoke:**
- Highlighting unfair advantage
- Motivating desire for justice
- Competitive contexts

**How to Evoke:**
- Show undeserved success of others
- Highlight unfair playing field
- Point to injustice

#### 8. Envy (Phthonos)
**When to Evoke:** Generally avoid (can backfire)
**If Used:** Channel toward motivation, not resentment

#### 9. Hope (Elpis)
**When to Evoke:**
- Inspiring action
- Painting vision of better future
- Sustaining through difficulty

**How to Evoke:**
- Vivid description of positive outcome
- Show path to achievement
- Provide evidence of possibility
- Connect to audience's desires

**Example:**
```
"Imagine walking into the office knowing your team is aligned, your processes flow
smoothly, and you're spending time on strategy instead of firefighting. That's not
a fantasy - it's what 150 companies like yours achieved within 90 days using this
approach. Here's the path to get there..."
```

### Emotional Appeal Techniques

#### 1. Storytelling
**Why It Works:**
- Engages emotions naturally
- Makes abstract concrete
- Creates identification
- Memorable

**Structure:**
```
Setup: Relatable character in relatable situation
Conflict: Challenge or obstacle
Struggle: Emotional journey
Resolution: How they succeeded/failed
Lesson: What this means for audience
```

**Example:**
```
"Last year, I met Sarah, a VP of Sales at a company like yours. She was working
70-hour weeks, team morale was low, and despite heroic efforts, they missed quota
for the third straight quarter.

She was exhausted, frustrated, and questioning her career choice.

Then she implemented [solution]. Within 90 days, her team hit 115% of quota. More
importantly, she now works 45-hour weeks, her team engagement scores doubled, and
last month she got promoted to SVP.

The difference wasn't working harder - it was working smarter with the right tools."
```

#### 2. Vivid Language
**Technique:** Use sensory details and concrete imagery.

**Comparison:**
```
❌ Abstract: "This will improve your efficiency"
✅ Vivid: "Imagine getting those weekly reports done by lunch Tuesday instead of
staying late Friday, actually enjoying your weekend instead of dreading Monday's
pile of work"

❌ Abstract: "Customer satisfaction will increase"
✅ Vivid: "Picture opening your inbox to find customer thank-you notes instead
of complaints. Imagine your support team smiling instead of stressed."
```

#### 3. Metaphors and Analogies
**Why They Work:** Transfer emotions from familiar to unfamiliar.

**Examples:**
```
"Your current system is like driving a car with three flat tires. You can still
move forward, but it's exhausting, inefficient, and eventually something's going
to break."

"Think of this as insurance for your business - you hope you never need it, but
when a crisis hits, you'll be grateful it's there."

"This isn't a sprint, it's a marathon. We need to pace ourselves for sustainable
success."
```

#### 4. Rhetorical Questions
**Technique:** Questions that provoke emotional reflection.

**Examples:**
```
"How much longer can you sustain this pace?"
"What would it mean to your family if you could be home for dinner every night?"
"Is this really the legacy you want to leave?"
"Don't you deserve better?"
```

#### 5. Contrast (Before/After)
**Technique:** Amplify emotional impact through comparison.

**Structure:**
```
Current State (Pain): Vivid description of current suffering
Arrow (Transition): "But it doesn't have to be this way..."
Future State (Relief): Vivid description of desired outcome
```

**Example:**
```
"Right now, you're spending 3 hours every morning just trying to find the information
you need, answering the same questions over and over, watching opportunities slip
away because you can't respond fast enough. [PAIN]

But imagine: Tomorrow morning, you log in, and the AI assistant has already prioritized
your day, answered routine questions, and flagged the 3 opportunities that need your
attention. You spend those 3 hours actually making progress instead of treading water.
[RELIEF]"
```

### Balancing Pathos

**Too Little Emotion:**
- Message feels dry and forgettable
- Fails to motivate action
- Loses attention

**Too Much Emotion:**
- Seems manipulative
- Overwhelms rational consideration
- Can backfire if feels exploitative

**Right Balance:**
```
Analytical Audiences: 70% Logos, 20% Ethos, 10% Pathos
General Audiences: 40% Pathos, 30% Logos, 30% Ethos
Highly Personal Topics: 50% Pathos, 30% Ethos, 20% Logos

(Adjust based on context and audience)
```

### Ethical Pathos

**Acceptable:**
- Authentic emotional appeals
- Highlighting real consequences
- Creating genuine connection
- Inspiring positive action

**Unacceptable:**
- Fabricating emotional stories
- Exploiting trauma
- Manufacturing fear without cause
- Emotional manipulation for selfish ends

## Logos: The Persuasion of Logic

### Definition

**Logos** is persuasion through logical argument and evidence. It answers the question: "Does this make sense?"

Aristotle emphasized both formal logic and persuasive reasoning (enthymemes).

### Forms of Logical Argument

#### 1. Deductive Reasoning (Syllogism)

**Structure:**
```
Major Premise: Universal principle
Minor Premise: Specific case
Conclusion: Logical necessity
```

**Example:**
```
Major Premise: All companies that reduce churn by 5% see profit increases of 25-95%
Minor Premise: Our solution reduces churn by 12% on average
Conclusion: Therefore, your company will likely see 60-200% profit increase

[Note: Aristotle would call this an "enthymeme" - rhetorical syllogism with probable premises]
```

**Applications:**
```
Policy Argument:
Premise 1: Successful companies invest 3-5% of revenue in R&D
Premise 2: We're currently investing 1%
Conclusion: We should increase R&D investment to remain competitive

Product Argument:
Premise 1: Security breaches cost $4M on average
Premise 2: Our security platform prevents 99% of common breaches
Conclusion: This platform pays for itself by preventing even a single breach
```

#### 2. Inductive Reasoning

**Structure:**
```
Specific Observation 1
Specific Observation 2
Specific Observation 3
...
General Conclusion
```

**Example:**
```
Company A implemented our solution → 40% productivity increase
Company B implemented our solution → 38% productivity increase
Company C implemented our solution → 42% productivity increase
[15 more examples...]

General Conclusion: Companies implementing our solution typically see ~40%
productivity increase
```

**Strength:** More examples = stronger induction (to a point)

**Weakness:** Induction is probabilistic, not certain

#### 3. Analogical Reasoning

**Structure:**
```
Situation A has characteristics X, Y, Z and result R
Situation B has characteristics X, Y, Z
Therefore, Situation B will likely have result R
```

**Example:**
```
"When Toyota revolutionized manufacturing with lean principles, traditional American
automakers dismissed it as 'not applicable to our context.' Those who adapted thrived;
those who didn't struggled.

Today, AI is bringing a similar revolution to knowledge work. Companies that adapt
early will have the same advantage Toyota had. Companies that dismiss it will face
the same fate as Detroit in the 1980s.

The question is: which company do you want to be?"
```

**Strength:** Makes unfamiliar familiar
**Weakness:** Analogies are never perfect; can break down under scrutiny

#### 4. Causal Reasoning

**Structure:**
```
X causes Y
Evidence that X is present/will occur
Therefore Y will happen
```

**Example:**
```
"Customer churn is caused by poor onboarding experiences - this is well-established
in research. Your current onboarding completion rate is 45%, meaning 55% of new
customers aren't properly onboarded. This directly explains your 40% first-year
churn rate.

If we improve onboarding completion to 85% (our clients' average), you'll reduce
churn to approximately 20% within a year. Here's the math..."
```

**Causal Chain:**
```
Poor onboarding → Low engagement → Churn
Good onboarding → High engagement → Retention
Therefore: Improving onboarding → Reducing churn
```

### Types of Evidence

#### 1. Statistical Data

**What It Is:** Quantitative information, metrics, percentages, averages.

**Strengths:**
- Objective and verifiable
- Shows magnitude and scale
- Compelling to analytical audiences

**Weaknesses:**
- Can be dry and abstract
- Easy to manipulate or misrepresent
- "Lies, damned lies, and statistics"

**Best Practices:**
```
✅ Cite credible sources
✅ Provide context (what do numbers mean?)
✅ Visualize when possible
✅ Combine with stories for impact
❌ Cherry-pick data
❌ Use misleading scales or comparisons
```

**Example:**
```
"Companies in your industry average 12% annual customer churn. You're at 18% -
that's 50% higher than peer average. At your average customer value of $50K,
that's $3M annually walking out the door that shouldn't be."
```

#### 2. Research Studies

**What It Is:** Peer-reviewed academic research, industry studies, scientific findings.

**Strengths:**
- High credibility
- Rigorous methodology
- Generalizable findings

**Weaknesses:**
- Can be inaccessible (jargon, paywalls)
- May not directly apply to specific situation
- Takes time to explain

**Best Practices:**
```
✅ Cite prestigious sources (Harvard, MIT, Nature, etc.)
✅ Translate findings into plain language
✅ Explain relevance to audience's situation
✅ Acknowledge limitations
```

**Example:**
```
"Research from Harvard Business School - and I can send you the paper - shows that
customer acquisition costs 5-25x more than retention. Yet most companies spend 80%
of their budget on acquisition and only 20% on retention. That's backwards."
```

#### 3. Case Studies and Examples

**What It Is:** Specific instances demonstrating outcomes.

**Strengths:**
- Concrete and relatable
- Shows real-world application
- Combines logos with pathos

**Weaknesses:**
- Anecdotal (single data point)
- May not be representative
- "That's them, not us"

**Best Practices:**
```
✅ Use similar/relatable examples
✅ Provide specific details and numbers
✅ Multiple cases (inductive strength)
✅ Explain why applicable
```

**Example:**
```
"Let me share what happened with Acme Corp - similar size, same industry, same region:

Year 1 (before our solution): $10M revenue, 18% churn, 60-day sales cycle
Year 2 (after implementation): $14M revenue, 9% churn, 35-day sales cycle

The specific changes they made were: [details]

These same dynamics apply to your situation because: [explanation]"
```

#### 4. Expert Testimony

**What It Is:** Opinions and recommendations from recognized authorities.

**Strengths:**
- Leverages expert credibility
- Shortcut to trust
- Particularly powerful for complex topics

**Weaknesses:**
- Experts disagree
- Credential doesn't guarantee correctness
- "Appeal to authority" logical fallacy if misused

**Best Practices:**
```
✅ Cite relevant expertise (not just any expert)
✅ Multiple expert consensus > Single expert
✅ Explain why expert's opinion is credible
```

**Example:**
```
"The cybersecurity approach I'm recommending isn't just my opinion. It's the consensus
recommendation from NIST, the DHS Cybersecurity Division, and the top 3 cybersecurity
firms. Here's what they say..."
```

#### 5. Direct Observation/Demonstration

**What It Is:** First-hand evidence, demonstrations, observable proof.

**Strengths:**
- Most convincing (seeing is believing)
- Removes abstraction
- Creates immediate understanding

**Weaknesses:**
- Not always feasible
- May not scale to full context

**Best Practices:**
```
✅ Offer trials and pilots
✅ Use live demonstrations
✅ Provide transparent access
✅ Let them experience directly
```

**Example:**
```
"Rather than just telling you this works, let me show you. I'll pull up your actual
data, run it through the tool live, and you'll see the analysis in real-time. Then
you decide if it's valuable."
```

### Logical Fallacies to Avoid

**1. Ad Hominem**
```
❌ "Don't listen to their criticism - they're just biased"
✅ "Let me address the substance of their criticism..."
```

**2. Straw Man**
```
❌ "My opponent wants to eliminate all regulations"
✅ "My opponent proposes reducing regulation X. Here's why that's problematic..."
```

**3. False Dichotomy**
```
❌ "Either we adopt this solution or face bankruptcy"
✅ "We have several options, but this one offers the best risk/reward profile because..."
```

**4. Slippery Slope**
```
❌ "If we allow remote work, soon no one will work at all"
✅ "Remote work presents challenges: X, Y, Z. Here's how we address them..."
```

**5. Appeal to Ignorance**
```
❌ "No one's proven this won't work, so it will work"
✅ "Here's the evidence it works: [positive evidence]"
```

**6. Circular Reasoning**
```
❌ "We're the best because we're better than everyone else"
✅ "We're the best based on these objective criteria: [evidence]"
```

**7. Hasty Generalization**
```
❌ "It worked once, so it will always work"
✅ "It worked in 47 of 50 cases. Here's why..."
```

### Constructing Logical Arguments

**Structure:**
```
1. State your claim clearly
2. Provide your reasoning (because...)
3. Support with evidence
4. Address counter-arguments
5. Restate conclusion with implications
```

**Example:**
```
Claim: "You should implement this system before Q3"

Reasoning: "Because the complexity of switching mid-quarter is significantly higher
than starting fresh at quarter beginning"

Evidence: "In our experience across 200 implementations, Q-beginning starts have
95% on-time completion vs. 70% for mid-quarter starts. The difference is clean
data cutover without disrupting active deals."

Counter-argument: "I know you're eager to see results sooner, but the 60-day
delay actually accelerates long-term value because implementation goes smoothly"

Conclusion: "So while it feels like waiting, starting Q3 gives you smoother launch,
faster adoption, and better ROI. It's worth the short wait."
```

## Integration: The Rhetorical Triangle

### Using All Three Together

Aristotle emphasized that maximum persuasion comes from combining all three appeals:

```
          ETHOS
         /     \
        /       \
       /         \
    PATHOS------LOGOS
```

**All Three Elements:**
- **Ethos:** "I'm credible and trustworthy"
- **Pathos:** "This matters emotionally"
- **Logos:** "This makes logical sense"

### Example: Complete Persuasive Message

**Context:** Persuading leadership to invest in employee development program

**Opening (Ethos):**
```
"I've led L&D initiatives at three Fortune 500 companies over 15 years, and I've
seen both successful and failed attempts at this. I want to share what I've learned,
because I genuinely believe this is the right move for our company's future."
```

**Problem + Emotion (Pathos):**
```
"Right now, our best people are leaving. Last quarter, we lost Sarah - 5 years of
institutional knowledge gone. Before her, Mike. Before him, Lisa. Each exit interview
says the same thing: 'No growth opportunities.'

Imagine being a talented employee here, watching your skills stagnate while your
friends at other companies are learning AI, leadership, cutting-edge skills. You'd
leave too.

We're not just losing people - we're losing the future leaders we need."
```

**Evidence + Logic (Logos):**
```
"The numbers are clear:

Current state:
- 22% annual turnover (industry average: 12%)
- $150K average replacement cost
- 15 exits this year = $2.25M in replacement costs alone

Research from MIT shows:
- Companies with strong L&D have 34% better retention
- ROI on employee development averages 250%

If we implement this $500K program and reduce turnover to even 16% (still above
average), we save $900K in replacement costs alone. That's 180% ROI before counting
productivity gains, engagement, innovation, etc.

Here's the case study from Acme Corp, similar size and industry: [specifics]"
```

**Vision + Emotion (Pathos + Ethos):**
```
"But this isn't just about costs. It's about being the kind of company that people
are proud to work for. Where people grow, thrive, and build careers.

I've worked at companies where people say 'I'm grateful for this job'
I've also worked at companies where people say 'I'm so lucky to work here'

I want us to be the second kind. And we can be."
```

**Call to Action (All Three):**
```
"I'm asking for approval to move forward with this program [Clear ask].

Based on the evidence and my experience, I'm confident this is the right investment
[Ethos + Logos].

More importantly, I think we owe it to our people - the ones who stayed through the
tough times, who believe in our mission [Pathos].

What questions can I answer?"
```

### Adapting the Mix

**Different audiences require different balances:**

| Audience Type | Ethos | Pathos | Logos |
|---------------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Engineers/Analysts** | 20% | 10% | 70% |
| **Creative Professionals** | 30% | 40% | 30% |
| **Executives** | 30% | 30% | 40% |
| **General Public** | 25% | 45% | 30% |
| **Academics** | 30% | 10% | 60% |
| **Sales/Marketing** | 25% | 40% | 35% |

*(Approximate - adjust based on specific context)*

## Conclusion

Aristotle's framework has endured for over two millennia because it captures fundamental truths about persuasion:

1. **People need to trust you** (Ethos)
2. **People need to care** (Pathos)
3. **People need rational justification** (Logos)

Master all three, adapt to your audience, and you'll be as persuasive as the ancient masters of rhetoric.

**Remember:**
- Ethos must be earned through character and competence
- Pathos must be authentic, not manipulative
- Logos must be sound, not sophistry

**Aristotle's Own Summary:**
> "Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds.
> Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the speech is so
> spoken as to make us think him credible; by putting the audience into a certain
> frame of mind; or by the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the
> speech itself."
>
> -- Aristotle, *Rhetoric*, Book I, Chapter 2

The best persuaders make all three appear effortless.
