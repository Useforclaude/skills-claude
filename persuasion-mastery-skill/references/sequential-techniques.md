# Sequential Persuasion Techniques Reference

## Overview

Sequential persuasion techniques leverage initial compliance or interaction to influence subsequent behavior. These multi-step approaches are often more effective than single requests.

---

## 1. Foot-in-the-Door (FITD)

**Discovered:** Freedman & Fraser (1966)

**Principle:** Small initial request increases compliance with larger follow-up request.

**Mechanism:**
- Self-perception change ("I'm helpful/charitable/civic-minded")
- Commitment and consistency
- Lowered barriers after initial compliance

**Classic Study:**
```
Control: "Place large 'Drive Safely' billboard in yard" → 17% compliance
Experimental:
  Week 1: "Sign safe driving petition" → 95% compliance
  Week 2: "Place billboard" → 55% compliance (3x increase!)
```

**Optimal Conditions:**
- Initial request must be behavioral (not just attitudinal)
- Gap between requests (not immediate)
- Same requester/organization
- Related requests (consistent domain)

**Applications:**
```
Sales: Free trial → Paid pilot → Full contract
Fundraising: Sign petition → Attend event → Donate
Marketing: Email signup → Download content → Purchase
```

## 2. Door-in-the-Face (DITF)

**Discovered:** Cialdini et al. (1975)

**Principle:** Large rejected request makes moderate request seem reasonable.

**Mechanism:**
- Reciprocal concessions
- Perceptual contrast
- Guilt reduction

**Classic Study:**
```
Control: "Volunteer 2 hours for field trip" → 17% compliance
Experimental:
  Request 1: "Volunteer weekly for 2 years" → 100% rejection
  Request 2: "Volunteer 2 hours for field trip" → 50% compliance (3x increase!)
```

**Optimal Conditions:**
- Initial request must be reasonable (not absurd)
- Same requester
- Immediate follow-up (same interaction)
- Show disappointment then "retreat"

**Applications:**
```
Negotiation: Ask $100K → "Settle for" $70K (target)
Sales: Premium package → Standard package
Fundraising: $500 donation → $50 donation
```

## 3. That's-Not-All (TNA)

**Discovered:** Burger (1986)

**Principle:** Adding incentives before response increases compliance.

**Mechanism:**
- Reciprocity (feeling of being given extra)
- Perceptual contrast (better deal than expected)
- Decision momentum

**Classic Study:**
```
Control: "Cupcake for 75¢" → 40% sales
Experimental: "Cupcake for 75¢... and I'll throw in 2 cookies" → 73% sales
```

**Key Difference from DITF:**
- No rejection occurs
- Continuously sweetens deal
- Creates "special treatment" feeling

**Applications:**
```
Sales: "$5K package... actually, I'll include implementation support too"
Infomercials: "But wait, there's more!"
Retail: "Plus free shipping" (added after price revealed)
```

---

## 4. Low-Ball Technique

**Discovered:** Cialdini et al. (1978)

**Principle:** Secure commitment, then reveal additional costs.

**Mechanism:**
- Initial commitment creates psychological ownership
- Sunk costs (mental investment already made)
- Consistency pressure

**Classic Study:**
```
Control: "Participate in study at 7am" → 24% agreement
Low-ball:
  Step 1: "Participate in study" → 56% agreement
  Step 2: "Oh, it's at 7am" → 53% still participated (double control!)
```

**Ethical Warning:** Borders on manipulation; use transparently.

**Ethical Alternative:**
```
"Base package: $10K. Optional add-ons: X ($2K), Y ($1K). Let's discuss what's
right for you."
```

---

## 5. Legitimization of Paltry Favors

**Discovered:** Cialdini & Schroeder (1976)

**Principle:** Explicitly stating "even a small amount helps" increases compliance.

**Mechanism:**
- Removes excuse ("too small to matter")
- Sets floor, not ceiling
- Social norms of generosity

**Classic Study:**
```
Control: "Would you donate to [cause]?" → Baseline
Experimental: "Would you donate to [cause]? Even a penny helps" → 50% increase in donors
Result: More donors AND average donation didn't decrease
```

**Applications:**
```
Fundraising: "Even $1 makes a difference"
Surveys: "Even 30 seconds helps us improve"
Feedback: "Even one suggestion would be valuable"
```

---

## 6. Disrupt-Then-Reframe (DTR)

**Discovered:** Davis & Knowles (1999)

**Principle:** Unusual presentation disrupts cognitive processing, making reframe more acceptable.

**Mechanism:**
- Cognitive disruption
- Reduced critical evaluation
- Need for sense-making

**Classic Study:**
```
Control: "Notecards for $3" → 40% sales
DTR: "Notecards for 300 pennies... that's $3, a bargain" → 80% sales (2x increase!)
```

**Applications:**
```
Pricing: "Only 3,000 pennies... just $30"
Time: "300,000 minutes of music... 5,000 hours for $10/month"
Scale: "100+ features... everything you need in one platform"
```

---

## 7. Pique Technique

**Discovered:** Santos et al. (1994)

**Principle:** Unusual requests capture attention and increase compliance.

**Mechanism:**
- Novelty breaks script
- Captures attention
- Increases engagement

**Classic Study:**
```
Control: "Can you spare a quarter?" → 23% compliance
Pique: "Can you spare 17 cents?" → 60% compliance
```

**Applications:**
```
Sales: "Can I have 8 minutes?" (vs. "10 minutes")
Pricing: "$997" (vs. "$1,000")
Offers: "Save 23%" (vs. "Save 20%")
Time: "7 reasons" (vs. "Top 10")
```

---

## 8. Fear-Then-Relief

**Discovered:** Dolinski et al. (1996)

**Principle:** Creating mild fear then providing relief increases compliance.

**Mechanism:**
- Emotional state management
- Gratitude for relief
- Positive association with reliever

**Classic Study:**
```
Scenario: Police officer stops driver → "You committed violation" (fear) →
"Just kidding, I'm doing a safety survey" (relief) → Compliance increased
```

**Ethical Application:**
```
"We found 15 critical vulnerabilities in your system [FEAR]
The good news: 12 can be fixed with simple update today [RELIEF]"
```

---

## 9. Labeling Technique

**Discovered:** Kraut (1973)

**Principle:** Assigning positive traits motivates behavior consistent with label.

**Mechanism:**
- Self-consistency motivation
- Identity reinforcement
- Self-fulfilling prophecy

**Classic Study:**
```
Control: "Please vote in Tuesday's election"
Labeling: "You're the kind of person who votes. Please vote Tuesday"
Result: Labeled group showed higher turnout
```

**Applications:**
```
"You're clearly someone who values quality..."
"You strike me as a strategic thinker..."
"You seem like someone who helps others..."
```

---

## 10. But-You-Are-Free (BYAF)

**Discovered:** Guéguen & Pascual (2000)

**Principle:** Emphasizing freedom to refuse doubles compliance.

**Mechanism:**
- Reduces reactance
- Perceived autonomy
- Decreases pressure

**Meta-Analysis:** 22,000+ participants across 42 studies → 2x compliance rate

**Key Phrases:**
```
"But obviously do not feel obliged"
"You're free to refuse"
"It's completely your choice"
"No pressure at all"
```

**Applications:**
```
Sales: "Would you be open to a demo? Of course, you're free to decline"
Surveys: "Would you complete this survey? Obviously no obligation"
Requests: "Could you help with X? Totally understand if you can't"
```

---

## 11. Pregiving

**Principle:** Give before asking (stronger than reciprocity alone).

**Mechanism:**
- Reciprocity norm activation
- Relationship building
- Perceived generosity

**Optimal Approach:**
```
Month 1: Valuable gift/service (no ask)
Month 2: Additional value (no ask)
Month 3: Third value-add (no ask)
Month 4: Make request (reciprocity activated)
```

**Applications:**
```
Content marketing: Valuable content before product pitch
Consulting: Free audit before engagement proposal
SaaS: Freemium with full features before upsell
```

---

## 12. Deadline Technique

**Principle:** Time scarcity motivates action.

**Mechanism:**
- Loss aversion
- Urgency creation
- Reduces procrastination

**Optimal Implementation:**
```
1. Establish legitimate deadline
2. Explain reason for deadline
3. Communicate consequences
4. Provide clear compliance path
5. Make action easy
```

**Applications:**
```
Sales: "Offer expires Friday due to end-of-quarter pricing"
Events: "Early bird ends [date]"
Limited releases: "Pre-order by [date] to guarantee delivery"
```

---

## 13. Social Proof Sequencing

**Principle:** Layer different types of social proof progressively.

**Optimal Sequence:**
```
Level 1: Popularity ("10,000 companies use this")
Level 2: Similar others ("47 in your industry")
Level 3: Specific similarity ("Like Acme Corp - same size, region")
Level 4: Personal testimony ("Their CEO says: [quote]")
```

**Mechanism:**
- Progressive relevance
- Compound credibility
- Addresses multiple objections

---

## 14. Inoculation Technique

**Discovered:** McGuire (1964)

**Principle:** Preemptively refute objections to build resistance to counter-arguments.

**Mechanism:**
- Creates cognitive "antibodies"
- Strengthens commitment
- Reduces competitor effectiveness

**Structure:**
```
1. Raise potential objection yourself
2. Provide strong refutation
3. Support with evidence
4. Person now "immunized" against objection
```

**Applications:**
```
Sales: "You'll hear competitors say X. Here's why that's outdated: [refutation]"
Politics: "Opponents will claim Y. Here are the facts: [refutation]"
PR: "Critics might suggest Z. Here's the reality: [refutation]"
```

---

## 15. Reciprocal Concessions Chain

**Principle:** Multiple concessions trigger strong reciprocity.

**Optimal Pattern:**
```
1. Start high (legitimate but ambitious)
2. Make visible concession #1 (small)
3. Make visible concession #2 (medium)
4. Request their concession (target)
```

**Example:**
```
"Standard package: $50K, 6-month timeline

Let me see what I can do... I can get you priority implementation - 4 months

If you commit by Friday, I'll also include training package (normally $5K extra)

Would you be able to bring your CFO to Friday's call to finalize?"

[Multiple concessions make your ask seem reasonable]
```

---

## 16. Decoy Effect (Asymmetric Dominance)

**Discovered:** Huber, Payne, & Puto (1982)

**Principle:** Adding inferior option makes target option appear better.

**Mechanism:**
- Perceptual contrast
- Easy comparison justifies choice

**Classic Example:**
```
Option A: Basic - $100 (10 features)
Option B: Premium - $200 (25 features)  ← TARGET
Option C: Mid-tier - $180 (18 features) ← DECOY (worse value than B)

Result: Option C presence increases B selection
```

**Applications:**
```
Subscription tiers: Add mid-tier that makes premium look like best value
Product lines: Position decoy to drive premium sales
Pricing: Show expensive option to make moderate option seem reasonable
```

---

## 17. Commitment Escalation

**Principle:** Progressive commitments through multiple steps.

**Optimal Escalation:**
```
Level 1: Informational ("Would you like to learn more?")
Level 2: Attention ("Would you attend a webinar?")
Level 3: Trial ("Would you pilot for 30 days?")
Level 4: Investment ("Would you roll out company-wide?")
Level 5: Advocacy ("Would you be a reference?")
```

**Mechanism:**
- Each step small and reasonable
- Prior commitment justifies next
- Self-perception evolves
- Consistency motivation compounds

---

## 18. Evoking Freedom

**Principle:** Highlighting choice increases perceived autonomy and compliance.

**Mechanism:**
- Reduces reactance
- Empowerment
- Ownership of decision

**Applications:**
```
"You have three options: A, B, or C. Which fits best?"
"There's no wrong answer - whatever works for you"
"What would you prefer?"
"You decide what makes sense"
```

---

## 19. Legitimization Techniques

**Types:**

**A) Authority Legitimization:**
```
"The [authority] recommends..."
"Industry standards suggest..."
```

**B) Social Legitimization:**
```
"Most people in your situation..."
"Typical approach is..."
```

**C) Reason Legitimization:**
```
"Because [genuine reason]..."
"To ensure [benefit]..."
```

**Research:** Even weak reasons increase compliance (Langer's "Xerox Study")

---

## 20. Multiple Commitments Strategy

**Principle:** Stack different commitment types for compound effect.

**Commitment Types:**
```
1. Public commitment (announced to others)
2. Written commitment (signed or documented)
3. Active commitment (taken action)
4. Identity commitment (part of self-concept)
5. Costly commitment (invested resources)
```

**Example:**
```
Sales process:
1. Public: "Can we announce partnership at conference?" (public)
2. Written: "Sign this letter of intent" (written)
3. Active: "Participate in solution design" (active)
4. Identity: "You're forward-thinking innovators" (identity)
5. Costly: "Small pilot investment" (costly)

Each layer strengthens overall commitment
```

## Integration: Combining Techniques

**Powerful Combinations:**

**FITD + BYAF:**
```
"Would you be willing to answer one quick question? [FITD]
Of course, you're free to decline [BYAF]"
```

**DITF + Legitimization:**
```
"Could you volunteer for 6 months? [Large ask]
Oh that's too much? What about one session? [DITF]
Most speakers find one session rewarding [Legitimization]"
```

**Labeling + Commitment:**
```
"You're clearly someone who values innovation [Label]
Would you be open to piloting our new approach? [Commitment]"
```

**Pregiving + Reciprocal Concessions:**
```
Month 1-2: Give value (Pregiving)
Month 3: Make offer with multiple concessions (Reciprocal concessions)
Result: Double reciprocity activation
```

## Ethical Guidelines

**Acceptable Sequential Persuasion:**
- Genuine value at each step
- Transparency about process
- Respects autonomy (BYAF)
- Serves audience's interests

**Unacceptable:**
- Deceptive escalation
- Trapping in bad decisions
- Exploiting commitment pressure
- Hidden agendas

**Key Principle:** Sequential techniques work because they're psychologically sophisticated, not because they trick people. Use to guide beneficial decisions, not manipulate harmful ones.
