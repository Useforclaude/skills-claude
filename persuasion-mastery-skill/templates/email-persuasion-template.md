3. Relevance (why now, why them)
4. Curiosity (make them want to read more)
```

### Body Copy Principles
```
- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Bullet points for scanability
- Bold key phrases
- One clear CTA
- Mobile-friendly length (150-200 words ideal)
```

### Persuasion Technique Checklist
```
□ Reciprocity: Did I give value first?
□ Commitment: Am I building on previous interaction?
□ Social Proof: Did I include relevant examples?
□ Authority: Did I establish credibility?
□ Liking: Did I personalize and find common ground?
□ Scarcity: Is there legitimate urgency?
□ BYAF: Did I emphasize their freedom to choose?
```

### Timing Strategy
```
Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Best times:
- 6-7am (before work starts)
- 12-1pm (lunch break)
- 5-6pm (end of day)

Email 2: Different angle, add more value
Wait: 5-7 days

Email 3: Soft breakup (creates urgency)
Wait: 2-3 days

Then test: Proof elements (which testimonials)
```

```

**7. No Proof**
```

✅ "We helped [Similar Company] grow by [specific %]"
```

**8. Missing BYAF**
```
❌ "I need to hear from you by Friday"
✅ "Let me know by Friday if this interests you - no pressure either way"
```

## Advanced Email Persuasion Tactics

### The Two-Part Email
```
Email 1: Pure value, no ask
Email 2 (few days later): "Since you found [Part 1] useful, thought you'd want [Part 2]"
→ Then transition to offer
```

### The "Breakup" Email
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

"I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming now isn't the right time.
Before I close your file, is there anything I should know?"

→ Highest response rate of any follow-up
→ Psychology: Loss aversion + scarcity of your attention
```

### The Cliffhanger Sequence
```
Email 1: Intro interesting case study
Email 2: "Part 2 of how they achieved [result]"
Email 3: "The final piece most people miss"

→ Zeigarnik effect: Open loops compel closing
```

### The Comparison Email
```
"I noticed you're using [Competitor]. Here's how we're different:

[Competitor] is great if [scenario A]
We're better if [scenario B - their situation]

Not saying one is better than the other - depends on priorities.
Want to discuss which aligns with your goals?"

→ Appears objective, actually persuasive
```

### The "Might Not Be Right" Email
```
"Based on what I know, this might not be the right fit for you if:
- [Disqualifier 1]
- [Disqualifier 2]
- [Disqualifier 3]

But if [their situation], then it could work really well.
Which camp are you in?"

→ Reactance reduction + qualification
```
