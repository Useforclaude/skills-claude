## 4. Support & Resistance {#support-resistance}

### 🎯 Types of S/R

**19. Horizontal S/R** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
Identification:

2. Round numbers (100.00, 1.2000)
3. Previous swing highs/lows
4. ATH/ATL (All-Time High/Low)

Strength Factors:

✅ Longer timeframe = stronger
✅ Round numbers = stronger
✅ Recent tests = more relevant
```

**20. Dynamic S/R (Moving Averages)** ⭐⭐⭐
```
Key MAs:
- 20 EMA: Short-term trend
- 50 EMA: Medium-term trend
- 200 EMA: Long-term trend (most important!)

Price above 200 EMA = Bull market
Price below 200 EMA = Bear market

✅ Use as dynamic support in uptrend
❌ Use as dynamic resistance in downtrend
```

**21. Fibonacci Retracements** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
Key Levels:
- 23.6%: Minor retracement
- 38.2%: Shallow retracement ⭐
- 50.0%: Psychological level ⭐⭐
- 61.8%: Golden ratio ⭐⭐⭐ (MOST IMPORTANT!)
- 78.6%: Deep retracement

How to Use:

2. Draw Fib from low to high (uptrend)
3. Watch for bounces at levels
4. 61.8% = best risk/reward

✅ Combine with S/R for confluence
```

**22. Supply & Demand Zones** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
Supply Zone (Resistance):
- Area where price fell sharply (sellers entered)
- Look for: Long bearish candles from zone
- Price returns → likely to fall again

Demand Zone (Support):
- Area where price rose sharply (buyers entered)
- Look for: Long bullish candles from zone
- Price returns → likely to rise again

✅ Entry: Touch zone + confirmation
✅ Stop: Beyond zone
✅ Fresh zones (untested) = stronger
```

---

## 5. Trendlines & Channels {#trendlines}

### 🎯 Trendline Rules

**23. Drawing Trendlines** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
Uptrend Line:
- Connect 2+ swing lows
- Price bounces off line (support)

Downtrend Line:
- Connect 2+ swing highs
- Price bounces off line (resistance)

✅ Validation: Needs 3+ touches
✅ Steeper line = weaker (unsustainable)
✅ Break = potential reversal

Trading:
1. Buy bounces in uptrend
2. Sell bounces in downtrend
3. Trade breakouts (reversal)
```

**24. Channels** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
Parallel Channel:
Upper ────/─────/─────
       /     /
Lower ─/─────/─────

Construction:

✅ Breakout: Trend acceleration/reversal
```

```
     HH
    /  \     HH
   /    \   /
  HL     HL

Uptrend = Series of HH + HL

Confirmation:
✅ Each high > previous high
✅ Each low > previous low
✅ Broken trendline = reversal

Trading:
- Enter: Pullback to HL
- Stop: Below recent HL
- Target: Next HH extension
```

**26. Lower Highs / Lower Lows (Downtrend)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
  \     LH
   \   /  \
    \ /    \
    LH     LL

Downtrend = Series of LH + LL

Trading:
- Enter: Bounce to LH
- Stop: Above recent LH
- Target: Next LL extension
```

**27. Break of Structure (BOS)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
Break of Structure = Trend change signal

Bullish BOS:
- Price breaks above previous HH
- Confirms uptrend continuation

Bearish BOS:
- Price breaks below previous LL
- Confirms downtrend continuation

Change of Character (CHoCH):
- Price breaks opposite structure
- Example: Uptrend breaks below HL
- Signals potential reversal
```

## 7. Order Flow & Supply/Demand {#order-flow}

### 🎯 Smart Money Concepts

**28. Liquidity Pools** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
Where liquidity sits:
1. Above swing highs (stop losses)
2. Below swing lows (stop losses)
3. Round numbers (pending orders)
4. Equal highs/lows (clusters)

Smart Money Strategy:
1. Hunt liquidity (trigger stops)
2. Fill orders at best price
3. Reverse direction (actual trade)

Retail: Buy breakout
Smart Money: Sell into breakout (liquidity grab)

✅ Watch for: False breakouts
✅ Entry: Reversal after liquidity grab
```

**29. Order Blocks** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
Order Block = Last candle before strong move

Bullish Order Block:
- Last bearish candle before strong rally
- Institutions bought here
- Price returns → support

Bearish Order Block:
- Last bullish candle before strong drop
- Institutions sold here
- Price returns → resistance

✅ Entry: Touch order block + confirmation
✅ Stop: Beyond order block
✅ High win rate (70-80%)
```

**30. Fair Value Gaps (FVG)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
FVG = Imbalance in price

Identification:
1. Three candles
2. Gap between candle 1 high and candle 3 low (bullish)
3. Gap between candle 1 low and candle 3 high (bearish)

Meaning: Price moved too fast, left inefficiency

Trading:
✅ Price returns to fill gap (50-75% retracement)
✅ Entry: Gap fill + confirmation
```

---

## 8. Multi-Timeframe Analysis {#multi-timeframe}

### 🎯 Top-Down Approach

**31. Three-Timeframe System** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
Example (Day Trading):
1. Daily (D1): Trend direction
2. 4-Hour (H4): Entry zones
3. 15-Min (M15): Entry trigger

Process:
Step 1 (D1): Identify trend
- Uptrend: Buy only
- Downtrend: Sell only
- Range: Both directions

Step 2 (H4): Find entry zones
- S/R levels
- Demand/supply zones
- Fibonacci levels

Step 3 (M15): Wait for trigger
- Candlestick pattern
- Break of structure
- Order block test

✅ All timeframes aligned = highest probability
❌ Against higher TF = lower probability
```

**32. Timeframe Ratios** ⭐⭐⭐
```
Rule: Use 1:4 or 1:6 ratio

Examples:
- Swing Trading: Monthly → Weekly → Daily
- Day Trading: Daily → H4 → H1/M15
- Scalping: H4 → M15 → M5/M1

✅ Maintain ratio for consistency
```

---

## 9. Entry & Exit Strategies {#entry-exit}

### 🎯 Entry Types

**33. Break & Retest** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
Process:
1. Price breaks S/R level
2. Price pulls back to test (retest)
3. Price bounces away
4. Enter on bounce

Why It Works:
- S/R flip: Support becomes resistance (vice versa)
- Stop hunters cleared
- Better entry price
- Lower risk

✅ Entry: Confirmation candle after retest
✅ Stop: Beyond retest zone
✅ Win rate: 70-80%
```

**34. Pullback Entry** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
In Uptrend:
1. Wait for pullback to support (MA, trendline, Fib)
2. Look for bullish reversal pattern
3. Enter on confirmation

In Downtrend:
1. Wait for bounce to resistance
2. Look for bearish reversal pattern
3. Enter on confirmation

✅ Never chase breakouts
✅ Wait for value zone
```

**35. Breakout Entry** ⭐⭐⭐
```
High Probability Breakouts:
1. Multiple tests of level (3+)
2. Volume increase on breakout
3. Strong momentum candle
4. Timeframe confluence

Entry:
✅ Conservative: Wait for retest
✅ Aggressive: Enter on breakout candle close

⚠️ False Breakout Risk:
- Use wider stop
- Reduce position size
- Confirm with volume
```

---

### 🎯 Stop Loss Placement

**36. Stop Loss Strategies** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
1. ATR-Based Stop:
   SL = Entry ± (2 × ATR)
   ✅ Adapts to volatility

2. Structure-Based Stop:
   SL = Beyond swing high/low
   ✅ Respects market structure

3. Percentage Stop:
   SL = Entry ± X%
   ❌ Arbitrary, not recommended

4. Time-Based Stop:
   Close if no movement after X bars
   ✅ Good for ranging markets

Best Practice: Combine structure + ATR
SL = Beyond structure + buffer (0.5 ATR)
```

**37. Take Profit Strategies** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
1. Fixed Risk/Reward:
   TP = Entry + (SL distance × R)
   Example: 2R = 2× stop distance

2. Key Level:
   TP = Next S/R level
   ✅ Natural exit point

3. Trailing Stop:
   Move SL as price advances
   ✅ Captures trends
   ❌ May exit early

4. Partial Exits:
   - 50% at 2R
   - 50% trailing to 5R+
   ✅ Balance profit taking + runners
```
