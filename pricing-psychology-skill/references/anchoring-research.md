## Overview

**Anchoring** (also called "anchoring and adjustment") is a cognitive bias where people rely too heavily on the first piece of information (the "anchor") when making decisions.

**Discovered by:** Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1974)

**Nobel Prize:** Kahneman won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics partly for this work

**Core finding:** Even completely random, irrelevant numbers influence subsequent judgments.

---

## The Original Discovery

### Tversky & Kahneman (1974) - The Wheel Experiment

**The study:**

Participants were asked to estimate the percentage of African nations in the United Nations.

**Method:**
1. Spin a wheel of fortune (rigged to stop at either 10 or 65)
2. Ask: "Is the percentage higher or lower than the number you spun?"
3. Ask: "What do you think the actual percentage is?"

**Results:**

| Wheel Number | Average Estimate |
|--------------|------------------|
| 10           | 25%              |
| 65           | 45%              |

**Key finding:** A completely random number influenced expert estimates by 20 percentage points!

**Implications:**
- Anchoring works even when anchor is irrelevant
- People don't adjust sufficiently from the anchor
- Effect is unconscious and automatic

---

### Why It Matters for Pricing

**If random numbers influence decisions, imagine the power of strategic price anchors:**

- First price shown becomes reference point
- All subsequent prices judged relative to anchor
- Higher anchor = higher willingness to pay
- People adjust insufficiently from anchors

**Example:**
- See "$1,000" first → "$500" feels cheap
- See "$100" first → "$500" feels expensive
- Same $500, different perception based on anchor!

---

## Key Research Studies

### Study 1: Ariely, Loewenstein & Prelec (2003) - Social Security Numbers

**"Coherent Arbitrariness"**

**The experiment:**

MIT students asked to:
1. Write down last two digits of Social Security number (e.g., 79)
2. State if they'd pay that amount in dollars for various products (wine, chocolate, etc.)
3. State their actual maximum willingness to pay

**Results:**

Students with high-digit SSNs bid 60-120% more than low-digit SSN students!

| Product | Low SSN (00-19) | High SSN (80-99) | Difference |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| Wine    | $8.64           | $27.91           | +223%      |
| Chocolate| $9.55          | $20.64           | +116%      |
| Keyboard | $16.09         | $55.64           | +246%      |

**Key finding:** Completely arbitrary numbers (SSN) influenced real willingness to pay massively.

**Implication for pricing:**
- First number matters enormously
- Even irrelevant numbers create anchors
- Strategic anchoring can increase WTP by 100%+

---

### Study 2: Nunes & Boatwright (2004) - Precise Anchors

**"The Precision Effect"**

**Finding:** Precise numbers are stronger anchors than round numbers.

**The experiment:**

Negotiate price of used car:

Group A: Seller asks $5,000 (round)
Group B: Seller asks $5,015 (precise)

**Results:**
- Round anchor ($5,000): Final prices varied widely
- Precise anchor ($5,015): Final prices clustered near anchor

**Why:** Precise numbers signal:
- More research/thought
- Less negotiable
- Firmer position

**Application:**
- B2B quote: $47,500 feels more researched than $50,000
- Exception: Prestige pricing (round signals confidence)

---

### Study 3: Galinsky & Mussweiler (2001) - First Offers

**"The Power of the First Offer in Negotiation"**

**Finding:** First offer explains 85% of final negotiated price.

**The experiment:**

Simulated job salary negotiations:

Group A: Employer opens with $60,000
Group B: Candidate opens with $90,000

**Results:**

| First Offer | Average Final Salary |
|-------------|----------------------|
| $60,000     | $65,000              |
| $90,000     | $82,000              |

**Difference:** $17,000 (26% higher) just from opening high!

**Application for pricing:**
- Never let customer anchor first
- Open with high price, negotiate down
- First number sets the range

---

### Study 4: Wansink, Kent & Hoch (1998) - Quantity Anchors

**"Quantity Limits as Anchors"**

**Finding:** Suggested quantities anchor purchase amounts.

**The experiment:**

Supermarket promotion:

Group A: "Campbell's Soup on Sale" (no limit)
Group B: "Campbell's Soup on Sale - Limit 12 per customer"

**Results:**

| Condition | Average Cans Purchased |
|-----------|------------------------|
| No limit  | 3.3 cans               |
| Limit 12  | 7.0 cans               |

**Effect:** 112% increase just from suggesting 12!

**Why:** "Limit 12" anchors customers to think 12 is reasonable amount.

**Application:**
- "Most customers buy 3 licenses" → Anchors at 3
- "Up to 10 users" → Anchors at 10
- Bundle sizes anchor purchase quantity

---

### Study 5: Simonson & Drolet (2004) - Compromise Effect

**"Anchoring and Valuation in Sequential Decisions"**

**Finding:** Middle option gets chosen 60%+ of the time.

**The experiment:**

Choose between beer options:

**Setup 1 (2 options):**
- Premium beer: $2.50
- Bargain beer: $1.80

Result: 80% chose bargain, 20% chose premium

**Setup 2 (3 options):**
- Super-premium: $3.50 (anchor)
- Premium beer: $2.50 (target)
- Bargain beer: $1.80

Result: 10% super-premium, 70% premium, 20% bargain

**Effect:** Adding expensive anchor made mid-tier most popular choice.

**Application:**
- Always show 3 tiers
- Make top tier expensive (anchor)
- Most will choose middle (your target)

---

### Study 6: Tversky & Kahneman (1981) - Anchoring Persistence

**"The Framing of Decisions"**

**Finding:** Anchors persist even when known to be arbitrary.

**Experiment 1:**
- Subjects told the anchor was random
- Anchoring effect still occurred
- Knowledge didn't reduce effect

**Experiment 2:**
- Experts in the domain tested
- Anchoring still influenced experts
- Expertise didn't eliminate bias

**Key insight:** Anchoring is unconscious and unavoidable.

**Application:**
- Don't worry that customers "know" you're anchoring
- Sophisticated buyers still affected
- Use anchoring even for expert audiences

---

## Mechanisms of Anchoring

### How Anchoring Works (Cognitive Process)

**Two-stage process:**

**Stage 1: Anchoring**
- First number encountered
- Becomes reference point
- Stored in working memory

**Stage 2: Insufficient Adjustment**
- Attempt to adjust from anchor
- Adjustment stops too soon
- Final estimate biased toward anchor

---

### Why Adjustment Is Insufficient

**Research by Epley & Gilovich (2006):**

**Three reasons:**

**1. Cognitive effort**
- Adjustment requires mental energy
- People are cognitively lazy
- Stop adjusting when "good enough"

**2. Uncertainty**
- Don't know correct value
- Anchor provides starting point
- Uncertainty increases anchoring effect

**3. Selective accessibility**
- Anchor primes related information
- Think of evidence consistent with anchor
- Biased information search

---

### Brain Mechanisms

**fMRI research (Quattrone et al., 2014):**

**Findings:**
- Anchors activate reward centers in brain
- Higher anchors = higher activation
- Brain "feels" higher value even for same item

**Implication:**
- Anchoring is neurological, not just logical
- Can't "logic" your way out of anchoring
- Primal brain response

---

## Anchoring in Pricing

### The First Price Effect

**Research:** Thomas & Morwitz (2005)

**Finding:** First price in a set becomes reference for all prices.

**Example study:**

**Low anchor first:**
- See $19.99 shirt
- Then see $49.99 shirt
- $49.99 feels expensive

**High anchor first:**
- See $149.99 shirt
- Then see $49.99 shirt
- $49.99 feels like a bargain

**Effect:** 30-40% difference in willingness to pay.

---

### Original Price Strikethrough

**Research:** Coulter & Coulter (2007)

**"Distortion of Price Discount Perceptions"**

**Finding:** Showing original price increases perceived value.

**The experiment:**

Same product, different presentations:

Group A: "$50" (price only)
Group B: "$100 $50" (strikethrough)
Group C: "Was $100, Now $50" (explicit)

**Results:**

| Presentation | Perceived Value | Purchase Intent |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Price only   | 5.2/10          | 4.8/10          |
| Strikethrough| 7.8/10          | 7.2/10          |
| Explicit     | 8.1/10          | 7.8/10          |

**Effect:** 50%+ increase in perceived value and purchase intent!

**Why:**
- $100 becomes anchor
- $50 feels like 50% off
- Discount perception drives value

**Application:**
- Show "regular price" (even if same price always)
- Use strikethrough visually
- Explicit "was/now" even stronger

---

### MSRP Anchoring

**Research:** Urbany, Bearden & Weilbaker (1988)

**"Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price"**

**Finding:** MSRP anchors value perception even when everyone discounts.

**The study:**

Product with different MSRP anchors:

Group A: No MSRP shown, price $50
Group B: MSRP $80, sale price $50
Group C: MSRP $120, sale price $50

**Results:**

| Condition | Perceived Value | Purchase Rate |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| No MSRP   | 6.1/10          | 32%           |
| MSRP $80  | 7.4/10          | 51%           |
| MSRP $120 | 8.7/10          | 68%           |

**Effect:** Higher MSRP anchor = higher value perception and sales!

**Application:**
- Always show MSRP/list price
- Higher MSRP = higher perceived value
- "Compare at" pricing works

---

### Competitor Price Anchoring

**Research:** Urbany & Dickson (1991)

**"Competitive Price Advertising"**

**Finding:** Showing competitor's higher price increases sales.

**Experiment:**

Retail store signage:

Group A: "Our price: $50"
Group B: "Our price: $50 (Competitor A: $65)"
Group C: "Our price: $50 (Competitor A: $65, Competitor B: $70)"

**Results:**

| Signage | Sales Increase |
|---------|----------------|
| A (price only) | Baseline |
| B (1 competitor) | +18% |
| C (2 competitors) | +31% |

**Why:**
- Competitor price anchors value
- Your price feels like a deal
- Multiple comparisons = stronger effect

**Application:**
- Show competitor pricing
- Multiple competitors better than one
- "Compare and save" messaging

---

## Quantified Effects

### How Much Do Anchors Affect Price?

**Meta-analysis (Furnham & Boo, 2011):**

Reviewed 100+ anchoring studies:

**Average effects:**
- Random anchors: 15-30% influence
- Strategic anchors: 30-60% influence
- Expert-provided anchors: 40-70% influence

**Translation to pricing:**

If you want to sell at $100:
- Low anchor ($50): Customers think it's worth ~$70
- No anchor: Customers think it's worth ~$90
- High anchor ($200): Customers think it's worth ~$130

**Effect:** Anchoring can change perceived value by 30-50%!

---

### Industry-Specific Effects

**E-commerce:**
- Showing original price: +20-30% conversion
- MSRP anchoring: +15-25% conversion

**SaaS:**
- Enterprise tier visible: +40% average plan value
- Annual pricing shown first: +60% choose annual

**Services:**
- High first quote: +25-40% final project value
- Package anchoring: +30-50% choose higher tier

**Real estate:**
- Listing price anchors offers within 5-10%
- Higher listing = higher final sale (even if longer time to sell)

---

## Moderating Factors

### When Is Anchoring Strongest?

**1. Uncertainty**

**Research:** Simmons, LeBoeuf & Nelson (2010)

**Finding:** More uncertainty = stronger anchoring.

**Application:**
- Complex products → anchor more effective
- Commodity products → anchor less effective

---

**2. Expertise**

**Research:** Northcraft & Neale (1987)

**"Expert Anchoring in Real Estate"**

**Finding:** Even experts are anchored (but less than novices).

**Study:**
- Real estate agents shown homes
- Given different listing prices
- Asked to appraise

**Results:**
- Novices: 40% influence from listing price
- Experts: 25% influence from listing price

**Key:** Experts still anchored significantly!

**Application:**
- Use anchoring even for sophisticated buyers
- Expect smaller but still meaningful effect

---

**3. Motivation**

**Research:** Epley & Gilovich (2001)

**Finding:** Monetary incentives reduce anchoring only 5-10%.

**Study:**
- Offered money for accurate estimates
- Anchoring still occurred
- Incentives helped slightly but not much

**Application:**
- Don't worry that "motivated" buyers won't be anchored
- Anchoring works even when stakes are high

---

**4. Anchor Plausibility**

**Research:** Strack & Mussweiler (1997)

**Finding:** Extreme anchors backfire.

**Study:**

Estimate Brandenburg Gate height:

Group A: Anchor 150 meters (plausible)
Group B: Anchor 1,500 meters (implausible)

**Results:**
- Plausible anchor: Strong influence
- Implausible anchor: Rejected, no influence

**Application:**
- Anchors must be believable
- Too extreme = counterproductive
- Sweet spot: 50-100% above target price

---

## Applications

### Retail Pricing

**Anchor high, sell mid:**

```
Original: $199
Sale: $99
→ $199 anchor makes $99 feel like steal
```

**MSRP anchoring:**

```
MSRP: $149.99
Our Price: $99.99
Save: $50 (33%)
```

---

### SaaS Pricing

**Enterprise tier anchoring:**

```
Enterprise: $999/month (custom features)
Pro: $99/month ← Target
Basic: $29/month
→ $999 makes $99 feel reasonable
```

**Annual pricing first:**

```
Annual: $990/year (shown first)
Monthly: $99/month
→ $990 anchor vs $99 small number
```

---

### Services

**Opening high in negotiation:**

```
Your first quote: $50,000
(Internal target: $35,000)
→ Anchors high, likely settle at $40k+
```

**Package comparison:**

```
VIP Package: $25,000 (anchor)
Standard Package: $10,000 (target)
Basic Package: $5,000
→ $25k makes $10k look reasonable
```

---

### B2B

**Total contract value:**

```
3-year contract: $500,000 (anchor)
vs.
$13,889/month
→ $500k anchor makes monthly feel small
```

**Cost of problem:**

```
Cost of current inefficiency: $100,000/year (anchor)
Our solution: $20,000/year
→ $100k anchor makes $20k feel like bargain
```

---

## Counteracting Anchors

### How to Avoid Being Anchored (When Buying)

**Research-based strategies:**

**1. Generate your own anchor first**
- Research fair price before seeing seller's price
- Create internal anchor
- Compare seller's anchor to yours

**2. Consider the opposite**
- Actively think about why anchor might be wrong
- Look for disconfirming evidence
- Reduces anchoring effect by 20-30%

**3. Wait before deciding**
- Time reduces anchoring effect
- Sleep on it
- Come back with fresh perspective

**4. Get multiple anchors**
- See many different prices
- Multiple anchors dilute effect
- Average mentally

**5. Focus on value, not anchor**
- Ignore seller's price
- Calculate value independently
- Make offer based on value
