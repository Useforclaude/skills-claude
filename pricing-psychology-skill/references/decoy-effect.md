## Overview

**The decoy effect** (also called "asymmetric dominance effect" or "attraction effect") occurs when a third option is introduced to make one of the original options more attractive.

**Core principle:** People don't evaluate options in isolation - they compare them to available alternatives.

**Discovery:** Joel Huber, John Payne, Christopher Puto (1982)

**Effect size:** 20-40% increase in selection of target option

**How it works:**
1. Start with 2 options (A and B)
2. Add option C (the decoy) - slightly worse than B
3. Option B suddenly looks much better
4. More people choose B

---

## The Discovery

### Huber, Payne & Puto (1982)

**"Adding Asymmetrically Dominated Alternatives: Violations of Regularity and the Similarity Hypothesis"**

**The original experiment:**

**Scenario:** Choose a beer

**Round 1 (2 options):**
- Premium beer: $2.60
- Bargain beer: $1.80

**Result:**
- 33% chose premium
- 67% chose bargain

---

**Round 2 (3 options with decoy):**
- Premium beer: $2.60 (target)
- Bargain beer: $1.80
- Super-premium beer: $3.40 (decoy - expensive but not much better)

**Result:**
- 47% chose premium (+42% increase!)
- 10% chose super-premium (decoy)
- 43% chose bargain

**Key finding:** Adding an option that nobody wanted (decoy) increased sales of the target by 42%!

---

**Why it worked:**
- Super-premium ($3.40) anchored value upward
- Premium ($2.60) now looked like good value
- Bargain ($1.80) stayed constant
- Relative comparison shifted in premium's favor

---

## How It Works

### The Psychology

**Three cognitive mechanisms:**

**1. Relative evaluation**
- Humans are bad at absolute judgments
- We judge by comparison
- Context shapes preference

**2. Asymmetric dominance**
- Decoy is clearly inferior to target
- Target "dominates" decoy (better on all dimensions)
- Dominating something feels good

**3. Justification**
- Need reason for choice
- "This one is better than that one" provides reason
- Decoy makes target easy to justify

---

### The Mathematics

**Value perception equation:**

```
Perceived value of target =
  Absolute value
  + Relative value (vs decoy)
  + Justification bonus
```

**Example:**

**Before decoy:**
- Option A: $100, value = $100
- Option B: $150, value = $150

**After adding decoy ($140, worse than B):**
- Option A: $100, value = $100
- Option B: $150, value = $180 (boosted by comparison!)
- Option C (decoy): $140, value = $120

**Result:** B's perceived value increased by $30 just from adding C!

---

## Classic Examples

### Example 1: The Economist (Most Famous)

**Dan Ariely's classic study:**

**Original pricing (2 options):**
- Digital only: $59
- Print + Digital: $125

**Customer choices:**
- 68% chose Digital ($59)
- 32% chose Print + Digital ($125)

**Revenue per 100 customers:** $8,012

---

**New pricing (3 options with decoy):**
- Digital only: $59
- Print only: $125 (DECOY - same price as Print+Digital!)
- Print + Digital: $125 (TARGET)

**Customer choices:**
- 16% chose Digital ($59)
- 0% chose Print only (decoy)
- 84% chose Print + Digital ($125)

**Revenue per 100 customers:** $11,444

**Impact:** +43% revenue from adding a "useless" option!

---

**Why it worked:**

Print-only at $125 makes Print+Digital at $125 look like amazing value:
- "I get Digital for FREE!"
- Clear winner in comparison
- Easy to justify

---

### Example 2: Williams Sonoma Bread Maker

**Original offering (1 option):**
- Bread maker: $275
- Sales: Moderate

**New offering (2 options with decoy):**
- Bread maker (original): $275 (target)
- Deluxe bread maker: $429 (decoy - 50% more expensive, only slightly better)

**Result:**
- Sales of $275 model nearly doubled
- Few people bought $429 model
- Total revenue up 60%

**Why:**
- $429 model made $275 look reasonable
- Anchoring effect
- $275 felt like "smart choice"

---

### Example 3: Movie Theater Popcorn

**Pricing:**
- Small: $3 (7 oz)
- Medium: $6.50 (10 oz) (DECOY)
- Large: $7 (20 oz) (TARGET)

**Analysis:**
- Small to Medium: +$3.50 for 3 oz = $1.17/oz
- Medium to Large: +$0.50 for 10 oz = $0.05/oz

**Psychology:**
- Medium is terrible value
- Large is amazing value by comparison
- "Only 50¢ more for twice the popcorn!"

**Result:** 70%+ choose Large

---

## Asymmetric Dominance

### What Makes a Good Decoy?

**Criteria for effective decoy:**

**1. Inferior to target on all dimensions**

Example:
```
Target: $100, 10 features
Decoy: $90, 5 features ← Dominated (worse value)
or
Decoy: $110, 8 features ← Dominated (worse value)
```

**2. Similar to target (not other options)**

✅ Good:
```
Option A: $30, basic
Option B: $100, premium (target)
Option C: $95, fewer features than B (decoy similar to B)
```

❌ Bad:
```
Option A: $30, basic
Option B: $100, premium (target)
Option C: $35, slightly better than A (decoy similar to A)
```

---

**3. Plausible but suboptimal**

✅ Plausible:
```
Basic: $50
Pro: $150 (limited users) (decoy)
Business: $180 (unlimited users) (target)
→ "Why pay $150 for limits when $180 is unlimited?"
```

❌ Implausible:
```
Basic: $50
Pro: $150 (WORSE features than Basic!) (fake decoy)
Business: $180
→ Obviously fake, damages trust
```

---

**4. Close in price to target**

✅ Effective:
```
Target: $100
Decoy: $90 or $110
→ Close enough to invite comparison
```

❌ Ineffective:
```
Target: $100
Decoy: $20 or $500
→ Too different, no comparison
```

---

### The Dominance Types

**1. Frequency dominance**
- Decoy has all target's features minus some
- Target dominates on feature count

Example:
```
Pro: 10 features, $80 (decoy)
Premium: 12 features, $100 (target)
→ Premium dominates on features
```

---

**2. Cost dominance**
- Decoy costs more but delivers same/less
- Target dominates on value

Example:
```
Option B: $150, Feature set X (decoy)
Option C: $150, Feature set X + Y + Z (target)
→ C dominates: same price, more features
```

---

**3. Efficiency dominance**
- Decoy has worse price-to-value ratio
- Target offers better bang for buck

Example:
```
Medium: $7 for 12 oz = $0.58/oz (decoy)
Large: $8 for 20 oz = $0.40/oz (target)
→ Large dominates on efficiency
```

---

## Research Evidence

### Study 1: Ariely (2008) - Predictably Irrational

**The Economist experiment detailed:**

**Setup:**
- 100 MIT students
- Real purchase decision
- Real money

**Version A (no decoy):**
```
Digital: $59
Print + Digital: $125
```

**Choices:**
- Digital: 68
- Print + Digital: 32
- Revenue: $8,012

---

**Version B (with decoy):**
```
Digital: $59
Print: $125 (decoy)
Print + Digital: $125
```

**Choices:**
- Digital: 16
- Print: 0
- Print + Digital: 84
- Revenue: $11,444

**Statistical significance:** p < 0.001 (highly significant)

**Effect size:** 43% revenue increase

---

### Study 2: Huber & Puto (1983)

**"Market Boundaries and Product Choice"**

**Tested:** Consumer products (beer, cars, restaurants, film)

**Average effect across all categories:**
- Target option selection increased 20-40%
- Decoy selected by 5-15%
- Alternative decreased by 15-30%

**Key finding:** Decoy effect works across diverse product categories.

---

### Study 3: Doyle et al. (1999)

**"Strategic Choice and the Decoy Effect"**

**Finding:** Decoy effect stronger when:
- More complex decision
- Higher uncertainty
- Less product knowledge

**Tested expertise levels:**

| Expertise | Decoy Effect Size |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Novice    | +35% to target    |
| Intermediate | +22% to target |
| Expert    | +12% to target    |

**Key insight:** Less knowledgeable customers more susceptible.

---

### Study 4: Tversky & Simonson (1993)

**"Context-Dependent Preferences"**

**Finding:** Decoy effect increases with:
- Similar options (harder to choose)
- Reversible decisions (less commitment fear)
- Positive framing (focus on gains)

**Effect modifiers:**

| Factor | Effect on Decoy Power |
|--------|----------------------|
| Options very similar | +40% stronger |
| Can return/cancel | +25% stronger |
| Gain-framed | +18% stronger |

---

## Designing Effective Decoys

### Framework 1: The "Too Close" Decoy

**Strategy:** Make decoy close in price but worse in value.

**Template:**
```
Basic: $X
Pro: $2.5X (limited features) ← DECOY
Premium: $3X (full features) ← TARGET
```

**Example:**
```
Basic: $30 (10 projects, 1 user)
Pro: $80 (50 projects, 1 user) ← DECOY
Premium: $100 (unlimited projects, 5 users) ← TARGET

Psychology:
- Pro to Premium: Only $20 more
- But Premium adds unlimited + 4 more users
- Premium is obvious choice if upgrading
```

---

### Framework 2: The "Equal Price" Decoy

**Strategy:** Decoy costs same as target but offers less.

**Template:**
```
Option A: $X (basic value)
Option B: $Y (good value) ← DECOY
Option C: $Y (great value) ← TARGET
```

**Example:**
```
Starter: $29 (10 GB storage)
Business: $79 (100 GB storage) ← DECOY
Enterprise: $79 (unlimited storage) ← TARGET

Psychology:
- "Why pay $79 for 100 GB when unlimited is same price?"
- No-brainer decision
```

---

### Framework 3: The "Feature Removal" Decoy

**Strategy:** Decoy is target minus key feature.

**Template:**
```
Full Package: $Y (everything) ← TARGET
Limited Package: $0.9Y (missing key feature) ← DECOY
Basic Package: $X (core only)
```

**Example:**
```
Premium: $100 (all features + AI tools) ← TARGET
Standard: $85 (all features, NO AI) ← DECOY
Basic: $30 (core features only)

Psychology:
- "Pay $85 to miss AI? Or $100 to get everything?"
- $15 difference feels small
- AI feels valuable
```

---

### Framework 4: The "Quantity" Decoy

**Strategy:** Use volume to create bad middle option.

**Template:**
```
Small: $X
Medium: $2X (only 1.5x quantity) ← DECOY
Large: $2.5X (3x quantity) ← TARGET
```

**Example:**
```
Small: $5 (8 oz) = $0.63/oz
Medium: $9 (12 oz) = $0.75/oz ← DECOY (worse value!)
Large: $11 (24 oz) = $0.46/oz ← TARGET

Psychology:
- Medium is worst value per oz
- Large is best value per oz
- "Only $2 more for double!"
```

---

### Framework 5: The "Temporal" Decoy

**Strategy:** Use billing frequency as decoy.

**Template:**
```
Monthly: $X/month ($12X/year)
Quarterly: $3.3X/quarter ($13.2X/year, save small amount) ← DECOY
Annual: $10X/year (save significantly) ← TARGET
```

**Example:**
```
Monthly: $30/month ($360/year)
Quarterly: $85/quarter ($340/year, save $20) ← DECOY
Annual: $240/year (save $120!) ← TARGET

Psychology:
- Quarterly shows commitment willing
- But annual savings way better
- "If I'm committing, might as well go annual"
```

---

## Application Frameworks

### SaaS 3-Tier Pricing

**Standard structure:**
```
Tier 1 (Entry): $X
Tier 2 (Decoy): $3X-4X (limited growth features)
Tier 3 (Target): $4X-5X (unlimited growth features)
```

**Real example:**
```
Starter: $29/month
- 1,000 contacts
- 1 user
- Email support

Growth: $99/month ← DECOY
- 10,000 contacts
- 3 users
- Email support

Business: $149/month ← TARGET
- Unlimited contacts
- 10 users
- Priority support + phone

Analysis:
- Growth to Business: Only $50 more
- Get unlimited contacts (vs 10k cap)
- Get 7 more users
- Get better support
- Business is obvious choice for growing companies
```

---

### E-commerce Product Tiers

**Framework:**
```
Good: Entry price, basic features
Better: Higher price, some limitations ← DECOY
Best: Slightly higher, no limitations ← TARGET
```

**Example (headphones):**
```
Standard: $79
- Good sound
- Wired
- 1-year warranty

Pro: $149 ← DECOY
- Great sound
- Wireless
- 1-year warranty

Pro+: $179 ← TARGET
- Great sound
- Wireless
- Noise cancellation
- 2-year warranty

Analysis:
- Pro to Pro+: Only $30 more
- Get noise cancellation (worth $50+ alone)
- Get extra year warranty
- Pro+ is best value
```

---

### Services Packaging

**Framework:**
```
DIY: Low price, no support
Managed: Higher price, limited support ← DECOY
Full-Service: Slightly higher, complete support ← TARGET
```

**Example (web hosting):**
```
Shared: $10/month
- Shared server
- Self-managed
- Community support

VPS: $50/month ← DECOY
- Dedicated resources
- Self-managed
- Email support

Managed VPS: $75/month ← TARGET
- Dedicated resources
- Fully managed
- 24/7 priority support

Analysis:
- If paying $50 for VPS, $25 more for management is bargain
- Managed eliminates technical headaches
- Support alone worth $25+
```

---

### Courses/Info Products

**Framework:**
```
Course Only: $X
Course + Bonuses: $2X-2.5X ← DECOY
Course + Bonuses + Coaching: $2.5X-3X ← TARGET
```

**Example:**
```
Core Course: $497
- 8-week program
- Video lessons
- Worksheets

Accelerator: $997 ← DECOY
- Core course
- Bonus modules
- Community access

VIP: $1,497 ← TARGET
- Core course
- Bonus modules
- Community access
- 4 group coaching calls
- Direct instructor access

Analysis:
- Accelerator to VIP: Only $500 more
- Get coaching (worth $1,000+)
- Get direct access (priceless for some)
- VIP is "best decision" for committed students
```

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Decoy Actually Good Value

**Wrong:**
```
Basic: $30
Pro: $60 (3x features) ← Meant to be decoy but actually great value!
Premium: $100 (4x features)

Problem: Pro is best value per feature
Result: Everyone chooses Pro (not Premium)
```

**Fixed:**
```
Basic: $30
Pro: $80 (2x features) ← Worse value than Premium
Premium: $100 (4x features) ← Best value

Result: Premium is obvious choice
```

---

### Mistake 2: Decoy Too Obvious

**Wrong:**
```
Basic: $50
Pro: $100 (Same as Basic but costs 2x!) ← Obviously fake decoy
Premium: $110

Problem: Feels manipulative
Result: Damages trust
```

**Fixed:**
```
Basic: $50
Pro: $100 (More features than Basic, fewer than Premium)
Premium: $110

Result: Believable comparison
```

---

### Mistake 3: Too Many Options

**Wrong:**
```
Tier 1: $10
Tier 2: $20
Tier 3: $30
Tier 4: $50
Tier 5: $100
Tier 6: $250

Problem: Paradox of choice, no clear decoy
Result: Analysis paralysis, fewer conversions
```

**Fixed:**
```
Tier 1: $30
Tier 2: $80 ← Decoy
Tier 3: $100 ← Target

Result: Clear choice architecture
```

---

### Mistake 4: Decoy Not Similar to Target

**Wrong:**
```
Basic: $10 (consumer grade)
Pro: $15 (slightly better consumer) ← Decoy similar to Basic
Enterprise: $500 (completely different tier)

Problem: Decoy doesn't make Enterprise attractive
Result: Decoy helps Basic, not Enterprise
```

**Fixed:**
```
Basic: $10
Pro: $100 ← Target
Enterprise: $90 (same as Pro but missing key feature) ← Decoy

Result: Decoy near target, makes target attractive
```

---

## Real-World Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Apple iPhone Storage

**Apple's pricing (iPhone 14 Pro):**
```
128 GB: $999
256 GB: $1,099 ← DECOY
512 GB: $1,299 ← TARGET (for power users)
1 TB: $1,499
```

**Analysis:**
- 128 to 256: +$100 for 128 GB more
- 256 to 512: +$200 for 256 GB more (better value per GB)
- 256 GB is decoy making 512 GB attractive

**Result:**
- According to analysts, 40% choose 512 GB (up from 25% previously)
- Average selling price increased $150+

---

### Case Study 2: Spotify

**Spotify pricing:**
```
Free: $0 (ads, limited features)
Premium: $9.99/month ← TARGET
Duo: $12.99/month (2 accounts)
Family: $15.99/month (6 accounts)
```

**Decoy mechanism:**
- Free tier is decoy making Premium attractive
- Ads are painful (time cost)
- $9.99 feels cheap to remove pain
- Most users upgrade to Premium

**Result:** 40%+ conversion from Free to Premium

---

### Case Study 3: Adobe Creative Cloud

**Pricing:**
```
Photography: $9.99/month (Lightroom + Photoshop only)
Single App: $20.99/month (any one app) ← DECOY
All Apps: $54.99/month (20+ apps) ← TARGET
```

**Analysis:**
- Single App at $20.99 is terrible value
- All Apps at $54.99 = 2.6 apps worth
- If you need 2+ apps, All Apps is obvious

**Result:**
- 60%+ of paid users on All Apps plan
- Average revenue per user increased 80%

---

## Testing Decoys

### A/B Test Framework

**Test 1: With vs without decoy**
```
Version A (no decoy):
- Basic: $30
- Premium: $100

Version B (with decoy):
- Basic: $30
- Pro: $85 ← Decoy
- Premium: $100

Measure:
- % choosing each option
- Average revenue per customer
- Total revenue
```

**Expected result:** Version B has more Premium selections and higher revenue.

---

**Test 2: Decoy position**
```
Version A:
- Basic: $30
- Pro: $80 (limited) ← Decoy below Premium
- Premium: $100 (unlimited)

Version B:
- Basic: $30
- Premium: $100 (unlimited)
- Pro+: $120 (unlimited + bonus) ← Decoy above Premium

Measure: Which decoy position drives more Premium sales?
```

---

**Test 3: Decoy feature set**
```
Version A:
- Pro: $80 (missing Feature X) ← Decoy
- Premium: $100 (has Feature X)

Version B:
- Pro: $80 (has Feature X, missing Feature Y) ← Decoy
- Premium: $100 (has both)

Measure: Which missing feature creates stronger Premium preference?
```

---

## Key Takeaways

**1. Decoys drive choices**
- Adding a "bad" option makes the "good" option better
- 20-40% increase in target selection
- Works across all industries

**2. Design matters**
- Decoy must be inferior to target
- Decoy must be similar to target
- Decoy must be plausible

**3. Three-tier is optimal**
- Too few options (2) = hard choice
- Right amount (3) = clear choice
- Too many (4+) = paralysis

**4. Positioning is key**
- Show all three options together
- Visual comparison helps
- Make differences clear

**5. Test and optimize**
- Try different decoy positions
- Try different feature sets
- Measure actual behavior, not surveys

**The decoy effect is one of the most reliable pricing psychology techniques. Use it to guide customers toward your target option while maintaining genuine value at all tiers.**
