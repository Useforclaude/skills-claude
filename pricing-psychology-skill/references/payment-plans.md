# Payment Plans - Psychology of Installments

## Overview

Payment plans reduce the psychological pain of paying by:
- Spreading cost over time
- Reducing immediate cash outlay
- Creating perception of affordability
- Lowering barrier to entry

**Effect:** 25-60% increase in conversions compared to full payment only.

---

## The Psychology

### 1. Mental Accounting (Thaler, 1999)

**Principle:** People treat money differently based on mental categories.

**Example:**
- $1,500 one-time = "Major purchase" category → High pain
- $500 × 3 = "Monthly bill" category → Lower pain

**Same total cost, different mental account!**

---

### 2. Temporal Discounting

**Principle:** Future costs feel less painful than present costs.

**Example:**
- Pay $1,000 today = Immediate pain
- Pay $333 today + $333 in 30 days + $333 in 60 days = Delayed pain
- Future payments discounted psychologically

---

### 3. The Focusing Illusion

**Principle:** We focus on what's in front of us, not total.

**Example:**
- See "$349/month" → Focus on $349
- Ignore that it's $1,047 total over 3 months
- Decision based on monthly payment, not total

---

## Payment Plan Strategies

### 1. The Simple Split

**Structure:** Equal payments over time

**Example:**
```
Pay in full: $997
OR
3 payments of $349 ($1,047 total)
```

**Premium:** 5% ($50)

**When to use:**
- Mid-ticket ($500-$5,000)
- First-time customers
- Limited budget audience

---

### 2. Deposit + Balance

**Structure:** Upfront deposit, balance later

**Example:**
```
Today: $297 deposit
30 days: $700 balance
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total: $997
```

**Psychology:**
- $297 gets them committed
- Sunk cost bias ensures completion
- 30 days to budget for balance

**When to use:**
- Services/courses
- Build commitment
- Ensure completion

---

### 3. Graduated Payments

**Structure:** Increasing payments over time

**Example:**
```
Month 1: $100
Month 2: $200
Month 3: $300
Month 4: $400
━━━━━━━━━━━
Total: $1,000
```

**Psychology:**
- Low entry point ($100)
- As value increases, willingness to pay increases
- Matches perceived value growth

**When to use:**
- Value delivered progressively
- Coaching programs
- Trust-building services

---

### 4. Subscription Model

**Structure:** Ongoing monthly payments

**Example:**
```
Monthly: $97/month (cancel anytime)
Annual: $970/year (save $194, 17% off)
```

**Psychology:**
- Monthly = low commitment
- "Cancel anytime" = safety
- Annual discount = commitment incentive

**When to use:**
- SaaS/software
- Ongoing value
- Recurring revenue model

---

## Pricing Payment Plans

### How Much Premium to Charge?

**Industry standards:**

**Low premium (0-5%):**
```
Full: $1,000
Plan: $1,000-1,050 (0-5% more)

When:
- Automated processing
- Low risk
- High completion rates
```

**Moderate premium (5-15%):**
```
Full: $1,000
Plan: $1,050-1,150 (5-15% more)

When:
- Some processing cost
- Moderate risk
- Standard approach
```

**High premium (15-25%):**
```
Full: $1,000
Plan: $1,150-1,250 (15-25% more)

When:
- High processing fees
- Higher risk
- Strong full-payment incentive
```

---

### Optimal Number of Payments

**Research:** Gourville & Soman (2002)

**Finding:** 2-4 payments optimal for most products.

| Payment Count | Pros | Cons |
|---------------|------|------|
| 2 payments | Higher per-payment, faster completion | Less accessible |
| 3 payments | **Optimal balance** | None |
| 4 payments | More accessible | Longer commitment |
| 6+ payments | Very accessible | High dropout, long timeline |

**Recommendation:** 3 payments for most offers.

## Presenting Payment Plans

### Option 1: Side-by-Side

```
┌──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│   PAY IN FULL    │   PAYMENT PLAN   │
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
│   $997 today     │  3 × $349/month  │
│   ✅ Save $50    │  ($1,047 total)  │
│                  │                  │
│ [Select]         │  [Select]        │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

**Psychology:**
- Equal prominence
- Customer chooses
- Savings visible

---

### Option 2: Primary with Alternative

```
[✓] Pay $997 today - SAVE $50!

[ ] Or 3 easy payments of $349
```

**Psychology:**
- Full payment pre-selected (default bias)
- Savings emphasized
- Payment plan as fallback

---

### Option 3: Minimized Total

```
3 easy payments of $349

[Select payment plan]

Small text: Total $1,047 over 3 months
```

**Psychology:**
- Focus on $349, not $1,047
- Minimize total visibility
- Emphasize monthly amount

**Warning:** Can feel deceptive. Use carefully.

---

## Payment Plan Copy

### Emphasize Benefits

**❌ Bad:**
- "3 payments of $349 ($1,047 total)"

**✅ Good:**
- "3 easy payments of $349"
- "Just $349 to get started"
- "Only 3 payments of $349"

---

### Show Full-Pay Savings

```
✅ Pay in full: $997 (Best value - Save $50!)

## Ensuring Completion

### 2. Deliver Value Upfront

**Strategy:** Give full access immediately

"Just 3 payments of $349!"
(Total hidden or in tiny text)

Problem: Feels deceptive
Fix: Show total clearly
```

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: No Full-Pay Incentive

Full: $997
Plan: $997 (same price)

Problem: Why pay full if no benefit?
