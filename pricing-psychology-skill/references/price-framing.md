# Price Framing - How You Present Price Matters

## Overview

**Price framing** is the practice of presenting the same price in different ways to change perception and increase conversion.

**Core principle:** The same price can feel expensive or cheap depending on how it's presented.

**Effect size:** 15-40% difference in willingness to pay based solely on framing.

## Temporal Framing

### Breaking Down by Time

**Research:** Gourville (1998) - "Pennies-a-Day Strategy"

**Finding:** Smaller time units make prices feel smaller.

**Examples:**

| Price | Annual | Monthly | Daily | Hourly |
|-------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| $1,200 | $1,200/yr | $100/mo | $3.28/day | $0.14/hr |

**Conversion impact:**

| Frame | Conversion Rate (Study) |
|-------|-------------------------|
| $1,200/year | 32% |
| $100/month | 51% (+59%) |
| $3.28/day | 68% (+113%) |

---

### The "Less Than" Frame

**Formula:** "Less than [familiar purchase] per [time period]"

**Examples:**

**SaaS:**
- "$3/day" → "Less than a coffee per day"
- "$10/day" → "Less than lunch per day"
- "$30/day" → "Less than a tank of gas per day"

**Gym membership:**
- "$600/year" → "$50/month" → "$1.64/day"
- Frame: "Less than a bottle of water per day for your health"

**Insurance:**
- "$1,200/year" → "$3.28/day"
- Frame: "Less than a latte per day for complete peace of mind"

**Effect:** Makes price relatable and trivial-feeling.

---

## Value Comparison Framing

### Cost vs. Value Delivered

**Research:** Thaler (1985) - "Mental Accounting"

**Finding:** Frame price as investment in value, not expense.

**Example transformations:**

**Before (cost frame):**
- "Costs $5,000"

**After (value frame):**
- "Invest $5,000 to generate $50,000/year" (10x ROI)
- "Spend $5,000 once, save $10,000/year forever" (pays back in 6 months)
- "Pay $5,000 to save 500 hours" ($10/hour for your time)

---

### ROI Framing

**Formula:** Show return on investment explicitly.

**Template:**
```
Investment: $X
Return: $Y/month
━━━━━━━━━━
ROI: Z% or Zx
Payback: N months
```

**Example:**
```
Investment: $10,000 marketing campaign
Expected return: $5,000/month in new sales
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ROI: 500% in year one (5x)
Payback period: 2 months
```

**Effect:** Shifts from "expense" to "investment" mindset.

---

## Loss Aversion Framing

### Preventing Loss vs. Achieving Gain

**Research:** Kahneman & Tversky (1979) - "Prospect Theory"

**Finding:** People are 2x more motivated to avoid losses than achieve gains.

**Examples:**

**Gain frame (weaker):**
- "Earn $10,000 more per year"

**Loss frame (stronger):**
- "Stop losing $10,000 per year to inefficiency"

**Study results:**

| Frame | Conversion Rate |
|-------|-----------------|
| "Save $100" | 42% |
| "Don't lose $100" | 67% (+60%) |

---

### Opportunity Cost Framing

**Formula:** Frame as cost of NOT buying.

**Examples:**

**Before:**
- "Course costs $997"

**After:**
- "Not taking this course could cost you $50,000+ in missed opportunities"
- "The real cost isn't $997 - it's the $50,000 you'll miss out on"

**Software:**
- "Not using our tool costs you 10 hours/week = $26,000/year in wasted time"

---

## Bundling Framing

### Sum of Parts vs. Bundle Price

**Research:** Yadav (1994) - "Bundle Framing Effects"

**Finding:** Showing sum of parts increases perceived value.

**Template:**
```
If purchased separately:
- Item A: $X
- Item B: $Y
- Item C: $Z
━━━━━━━━━━━
Total value: $X+Y+Z

Bundle price: $P (less than total)
You save: $(X+Y+Z-P)
```

**Example:**
```
If purchased separately:
- Course: $297
- Templates: $97
- Coaching call: $197
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total value: $591

Bundle: $397
Save: $194 (33% off)
```

**Effect:** $591 anchors value high, $397 feels discounted.

---

## Magnitude Minimization

### Making Numbers Feel Smaller

**Techniques:**

**1. Remove commas:**
- ❌ $12,000 (looks longer)
- ✅ $12000 (looks shorter)

**2. Use "K" abbreviation:**
- ❌ $15,000 (five digits)
- ✅ $15K (three characters)

**3. Remove decimals:**
- ❌ $1,234.56
- ✅ $1,235 (cleaner)

**4. Use "only" qualifier:**
- ❌ $497
- ✅ Only $497

---

## Payment Optionality Framing

### Presenting Multiple Payment Options

**Research:** Soman & Gourville (2001)

**Finding:** Offering choice reduces psychological cost.

**Framework:**

```
Option 1: Pay in full - $997 ✅ Save $50!
Option 2: 3 payments of $349 ($1,047 total)
```

**Why this works:**
- Choice reduces resistance
- Full payment incentivized (savings)
- Payment plan available (safety net)
- Most choose payment plan but some choose full
- Higher total revenue than single option

---

## Granularity Framing

### Specific vs. Round Numbers

**Research:** Thomas, Simon & Kadiyali (2010)

**Finding:** Precise numbers feel more credible.

**Examples:**

**Discounts:**
- ❌ "Save 50%" (feels made up)
- ✅ "Save 47%" (feels calculated, real)

**Pricing:**
- ❌ "$500" (round, negotiable)
- ✅ "$487" (specific, researched)

**Statistics:**
- ❌ "Most customers save money"
- ✅ "87% of customers save an average of $4,237/year"

**Effect:** Specificity = credibility = higher conversion.

---

## Context Framing

### Situational Value Presentation

**Productivity context:**
```
"If this saves you just 1 hour per week...
→ 52 hours/year saved
→ Your time worth $100/hour = $5,200 value
→ Tool costs: $497
→ Net gain: $4,703/year"
```

**Revenue context:**
```
"If this generates just 1 extra customer per month...
→ Average customer value: $500
→ 12 customers/year = $6,000 revenue
→ Tool costs: $1,000
→ ROI: 6x in year one"
```

---

## Anchor + Frame Combo

### Combining Techniques

**Example 1: Discount framing**
```
Regular price: $1,000 ← Anchor
TODAY ONLY: $497 ← Time scarcity
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Save: $503 (over 50% off!) ← Loss aversion
Just $1.36/day ← Temporal framing

Multiple psychological triggers:
1. High anchor ($1,000)
2. Time pressure (today only)
3. Large savings ($503)
4. Percentage emphasis (50%+)
5. Daily cost trivialization ($1.36)
```

**Example 2: Investment framing**
```
Generate $10,000/month ← Value anchor
Investment: Just $500/month ← Minimized cost
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
That's $16.67/day to earn $333/day
ROI: 20x (2,000%)
Pays for itself in: 1.5 days

Psychological elements:
1. High value anchor ($10k)
2. Minimized investment ("just $500")
3. Daily breakdown (amplifies ROI)
4. Percentage ROI (impressive)
5. Fast payback (urgency)
```

---

## Negative Framing

### When to Use Negative Frames

**Research:** Levin, Schneider & Gaeth (1998)

**Finding:** Negative frames work for prevention, positive for promotion.

**Prevention (negative frame better):**
- Insurance: "Don't risk losing everything"
- Security: "Prevent $50,000 in fraud losses"
- Backup: "Don't lose years of work"

**Promotion (positive frame better):**
- Growth tools: "Gain 1,000 new customers"
- Productivity: "Save 10 hours per week"
- Income: "Earn $50,000 more per year"

---

## Testing Price Framing

### A/B Test Framework

**Test 1: Temporal framing**
```
A: "$1,200/year"
B: "$100/month"
C: "$3.28/day"

Measure: Conversion rate
Hypothesis: Daily framing converts best
```

**Test 2: Value framing**
```
A: "$497 course"
B: "Invest $497 to earn $5,000/month"

Measure: Conversion + perceived value
Hypothesis: ROI framing increases both
```

**Test 3: Loss vs. gain framing**
```
A: "Save $10,000/year"
B: "Stop losing $10,000/year"

Measure: Conversion rate
Hypothesis: Loss frame converts better
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Same price, different feeling**
   - $1,200/year feels expensive
   - $3.28/day feels cheap
   - Same exact price!

2. **Choose right time unit**
   - Smaller units = smaller feeling
   - Daily beats monthly beats annual
   - But match billing cycle

3. **Frame as investment, not cost**
   - Show ROI
   - Emphasize value delivered
   - Calculate payback period

4. **Use loss aversion**
   - "Stop losing" > "Start gaining"
   - 2x psychological power
   - Especially for prevention

5. **Test everything**
   - Framing effects vary by audience
   - A/B test to find optimal
   - Track revenue, not just conversion

**Remember:** The frame matters as much as the price. Master framing to maximize conversions without changing actual price.
