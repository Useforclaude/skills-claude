## 🎯 Pricing Strategy Fundamentals {#fundamentals}

### What is Pricing Strategy?

**Definition:** The methodology you use to determine what price to charge for your product or service.

**Key Question:**
> **"Not HOW to present the price (that's psychology), but WHAT price to set and WHY."**

### The Pricing Triangle

```
         VALUE
          /\
         /  \
        /    \
       /      \
      /        \
     /          \
    /            \
   /______________\
 COST          COMPETITION
```

**Every pricing decision balances 3 factors:**
1. **Cost:** What does it cost you to deliver? (floor)
2. **Value:** What value does customer receive? (ceiling)
3. **Competition:** What do competitors charge? (market reference)

### Pricing Strategy Spectrum

```

### 9 Major Pricing Strategies

| **Strategy** | **When to Use** | **Goal** | **Risk** |
|--------------|----------------|----------|---------|
| **Cost-Plus** | Commodity products, low competition | Cover costs + margin | Low profit |
| **Value-Based** | Unique value, strong differentiation | Maximum profit | Hard to measure value |
| **Competitive** | Mature markets, similar products | Match market | Race to bottom |
| **Penetration** | New market entry, network effects | Gain market share fast | Low margins initially |
| **Skimming** | Innovative products, early adopters | Maximize early profit | Limits growth |
| **Dynamic** | Fluctuating demand (hotels, airlines) | Optimize revenue | Complex to manage |
| **Freemium** | Digital products, viral potential | Scale user base | Conversion challenge |
| **Tiered** | SaaS, subscriptions | Serve multiple segments | Complexity |
| **Bundle** | Multiple products, cross-sell | Increase transaction size | Margin dilution |

---

## 📊 Cost-Plus Pricing {#cost-plus}

### Definition

**Cost-Plus = Cost + Desired Margin**

**Formula:**
```
Price = Total Cost × (1 + Markup %)

Example:
Cost = 100 THB
Markup = 50%
Price = 100 × 1.50 = 150 THB
```

### When to Use

✅ **Good for:**
- Commodity products (difficult to differentiate)
- B2B contracts (transparent pricing expected)
- Government contracts (cost justification required)
- Low-margin industries (retail, wholesale)

❌ **Bad for:**
- Innovative products (leaves money on table)
- High-value services (underprice your value)
- Dynamic markets (can't adjust quickly)

### Types of Costs

**1. Variable Costs**
```
Costs that change with volume:
- Raw materials
- Packaging
- Shipping
- Transaction fees

Example (Dumpling):
- Flour, meat, vegetables: 2 THB per dumpling
- Sell 100 dumplings → 200 THB cost
- Sell 1,000 dumplings → 2,000 THB cost
```

**2. Fixed Costs**
```
Costs that don't change with volume:
- Rent
- Salaries
- Equipment
- Insurance

Example (Dumpling Shop):
- Rent: 30,000 THB/month (same if sell 1 or 10,000 dumplings)
- Salaries: 50,000 THB/month
- Fixed costs: 80,000 THB/month
```

**3. Total Cost (Break-Even Analysis)**
```
Total Cost = Fixed Costs + (Variable Cost × Quantity)

Example:
Fixed: 80,000 THB
Variable: 2 THB per dumpling
Sell 10,000 dumplings:
Total Cost = 80,000 + (2 × 10,000) = 100,000 THB

Price per dumpling = 100,000 / 10,000 = 10 THB (break-even)
Add 50% margin = 15 THB (selling price)
```

### Markup Guidelines by Industry

| **Industry** | **Typical Markup** | **Example** |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Grocery/Retail | 20-50% | Buy 80 THB, Sell 100-120 THB |
| Restaurant (Food) | 300-400% | Cost 25 THB, Sell 100 THB |
| Clothing | 100-200% | Cost 200 THB, Sell 400-600 THB |
| Jewelry | 200-400% | Cost 1,000 THB, Sell 3,000-5,000 THB |
| Software/SaaS | 1,000-10,000% | Cost $1, Sell $100 (mostly fixed costs) |

### Case Study: Charles House Flow Water (4 THB)

**From: dmarketing-trip.md**

**Product:** Mineral water in premium packaging (looks like wine)

**Cost Breakdown (Estimated):**
```
Variable Costs:
- PET bottle: 0.50 THB
- Label printing: 0.30 THB
- Water (purified): 0.10 THB
- Cap: 0.10 THB
Total Variable: 1.00 THB per bottle

Fixed Costs (Monthly):
- Factory rent: 100,000 THB
- Machinery: 50,000 THB
- Salaries: 150,000 THB
Total Fixed: 300,000 THB/month

Volume: 1 million bottles/month
Fixed cost per bottle: 300,000 / 1,000,000 = 0.30 THB

Total Cost per Bottle: 1.00 + 0.30 = 1.30 THB
```

**Pricing:**
```
Selling Price: 4 THB
Cost: 1.30 THB
Profit per Bottle: 4 - 1.30 = 2.70 THB
Margin: 2.70 / 4 = 67.5%

Monthly Profit:
1M bottles × 2.70 THB = 2,700,000 THB profit
```

**Why This Works:**
- **High volume strategy** (penetration pricing, covered later)
- Low cost + premium perception = high perceived value
- 67.5% margin sustainable at scale

---

## 💎 Value-Based Pricing {#value-based}

### Definition

**Value-Based = Price based on customer's perceived value, NOT your cost**

**Formula:**
```
Price = Willingness to Pay (based on value received)

NOT: Price = Cost + Margin
```

### Key Principle

> **"People don't pay for what it COSTS you. They pay for what it's WORTH to them."**

**Example:**
```
iPhone:
- Cost to make: $500
- Selling price: $1,000
- Customer value: "Status, ecosystem, camera quality" = Worth $1,000+ to them

Cost-plus would price at $600 (leaves $400 on table!)
Value-based prices at $1,000 (captures full value)
```

### When to Use

✅ **Good for:**
- Unique products (no direct comparison)
- High-value services (consulting, legal, medical)
- Luxury goods (status value)
- B2B solutions (ROI-driven)
- Innovative products (iPhone, Tesla)

❌ **Bad for:**
- Commodities (customers compare on price only)
- Transparent cost structures (customers know your costs)
- Price-sensitive markets (race to bottom)

### How to Calculate Value-Based Price

**Step 1: Identify Customer Outcomes**
```
What problem do you solve?
What value do you create?

Example (Driving School + Insurance):
- Problem: New drivers need license + insurance
- Value created: Time saved + guaranteed insurance approval
```

**Step 2: Quantify Economic Value**
```
What does customer gain/save?

Example:
Traditional path:
- Driving school: 5,000 THB
- Insurance shopping: 10 hours × 500 THB/hr = 5,000 THB (opportunity cost)
- Insurance: 15,000 THB (might get rejected, need to reapply)
Total: 25,000 THB + hassle

Your solution:
- All-in-one: License + guaranteed insurance
- Time: 0 hours (you handle everything)
- Total value: 25,000 THB + 5,000 THB (hassle removal) = 30,000 THB

Value-based price: 18,000 THB (customer saves 12,000 THB, you earn 18,000 THB)
Your cost: 10,000 THB
Profit: 8,000 THB per customer
```

**Step 3: Anchor to Alternatives**
```
What's the next best alternative?

Example (O'Leave Homework App):
- Alternative 1: Hire tutor (1,000 THB/hour × 10 hours = 10,000 THB/month)
- Alternative 2: Buy textbooks (2,000 THB one-time)
- Alternative 3: ChatGPT ($20/month but not homework-specific)

O'Leave value:
- Unlimited homework help: 10,000 THB value (vs tutor)
- Specialized for students: Better than ChatGPT
- Photo upload: Better than typing

Value-based price: $9.99/week ($40/month) → Customer saves 9,000 THB vs tutor!
```

### Case Study: Driving School (27 Revenue Streams)

**From: เทคนิคการตลาดแบบจีน.md**

**Traditional Driving School:**
```
Service: Teach driving
Cost: 5,000 THB
Price: 8,000 THB (cost-plus)
Profit: 3,000 THB per student
```

**Value-Based Driving School:**
```
Service: License + Insurance + Car purchase consultation
Cost: 10,000 THB
Price: 20,000 THB
Profit: 10,000 THB per student

Why customers pay 20,000 THB:
1. Guaranteed license (no retake)
2. Insurance approved (no rejection)
3. Car purchase discount (dealership partnership)
4. Refundable deposit if drive safely (5,000 THB back)

Total value to customer: 30,000+ THB
Price: 20,000 THB (33% discount on value)
Perceived as "great deal"

Additional revenue (hidden):
- Insurance commission: 3,000 THB
- Car dealership commission: 10,000 THB
- Extended warranty: 2,000 THB
Total per student: 10,000 (profit) + 15,000 (commissions) = 25,000 THB!

Cost-plus thinking: 8,000 THB revenue
Value-based thinking: 20,000 THB revenue
Backend revenue: +15,000 THB
Total: 35,000 THB per customer (4.4x more!)
```

**Key Insight:**
> **"Price based on OUTCOME (license + insurance + car), not ACTIVITY (driving lessons)."**

---

## 🏁 Competitive Pricing {#competitive}

### Definition

**Competitive Pricing = Match or slightly undercut competitor prices**

**Formula:**
```
Your Price = Competitor's Price ± X%

Where:
- Below (-X%): Gain market share
- Match (0%): Compete on other factors
- Above (+X%): Differentiation required
```

### When to Use

✅ **Good for:**
- Mature markets (established pricing)
- Similar products (hard to differentiate)
- Price-sensitive customers (compare before buying)
- Commodity markets (rice, water, gas)

❌ **Bad for:**
- Unique products (no comparable competitors)
- Blue ocean markets (you define the price)
- Premium positioning (want to be expensive)

### Competitive Positioning Matrix

```
        High Quality
             ↑
             |
  Premium    |   Overpriced
  (Apple)    |   (Avoid!)
             |
────────────────────────
  Value      |   Budget
  (Xiaomi)   |   (Generic)
             |
             ↓
        Low Quality
```

### Pricing Relative to Competition

**1. Price Leader (Most Expensive)**
```
Strategy: Premium positioning
Price: +20-50% above competitors
Requirements:
- Superior quality/features
- Strong brand
- Excellent service
- Loyal customers

Example: iPhone ($1,000) vs Android ($300-700)
```

**2. Price Matcher (Market Rate)**
```
Strategy: Compete on other factors
Price: ±5% of competitors
Requirements:
- Differentiation (service, convenience, brand)
- Efficiency (same margin at market price)
- Strong execution

Example: Pepsi vs Coca-Cola (similar pricing, compete on taste/brand)
```

**3. Price Fighter (Lowest)**
```
Strategy: Volume through low price
Price: -15-30% below competitors
Requirements:
- Low-cost operations
- High volume
- Efficiency
- Scalability

Example: Walmart, 7-Eleven (economies of scale)
```

### Case Study: BBQ Restaurant Membership (495 THB)

**From: เทคนิคการตลาดแบบจีน.md**

**Competitive Analysis:**

**Competitors (Traditional BBQ):**
```
Average bill: 500-800 THB per visit
No membership
Pay per visit
```

**Their Strategy:**
```
Membership: 495 THB/year
Benefits:
- 10 free beers (value: 60 THB × 10 = 600 THB)
- 1 grilled fish (value: 150 THB)
- Discounts on other items

Total value: 750 THB for 495 THB membership
→ 34% discount (appears as "great deal")

Competitive positioning:
- Cheaper than 1 normal visit (500-800 THB)
- But requires membership (lock-in)
- Upsell on every visit (average spend: 300-500 THB extra)

Annual value per member:
- Membership fee: 495 THB
- 20 visits/year × 400 THB average spend = 8,000 THB
- Total revenue per member: 8,495 THB/year

Competitor revenue:
- 20 visits/year × 600 THB = 12,000 THB/year
- BUT lower visit frequency (no lock-in)

Their advantage:
- Higher visit frequency (membership psychology)
- Predictable revenue (495 THB upfront)
- Higher lifetime value (8,495 THB > competitor's 6,000 THB from 10 visits)
```

**Competitive Insight:**
> **"Don't compete on per-visit price. Compete on membership value and visit frequency."**

## 🚀 Penetration Pricing {#penetration}

### Definition

**Penetration Pricing = Start with LOW price to gain market share quickly, then gradually increase**

**Strategy:**
```
Phase 1: Low price → Attract customers
Phase 2: Build loyalty & network effects
Phase 3: Raise prices slowly (customers already locked in)
```

### When to Use

✅ **Perfect for:**
- **New market entry** (need to grab share fast)
- **Network effects** (more users = more value)
- **Switching costs** (hard to leave once adopted)
- **Scale economies** (profit comes from volume)
- **Competitive markets** (break through noise)

❌ **Avoid if:**
- Premium positioning (want to be expensive)
- Luxury brand (low price = low quality perception)
- Can't sustain low margins (will lose money)
- No switching costs (customers leave when you raise prices)

### Penetration Pricing Formula

**Target:**
```
Entry Price = Competitor Price × 0.5-0.8 (20-50% cheaper)

Then raise gradually:
Year 1: 50% of competitor
Year 2: 70% of competitor
Year 3: 90% of competitor (already have market share)
```

### Case Study 1: Dumpling Shop (59 THB Annual Membership)

**From: เทคนิคการตลาดแบบจีน.md**

**Market Context:**
```
Competitor prices:
- Street food dumplings: 6 THB per piece (no membership)
- Sit-down restaurant: 10-15 THB per dumpling
```

**Their Penetration Strategy:**
```
Membership: 59 THB/year (insanely cheap!)
Benefit: 1 free dumpling per day (worth 6 THB)

Math:
- 59 THB membership / 365 days = 0.16 THB per day
- Free dumpling worth 6 THB
- Customer gets 6 THB for 0.16 THB (37x value!)

Why so cheap?
→ Penetration pricing to acquire customers fast
```

**Phases:**

**Phase 1: Acquisition (Year 1)**
```
Goal: Get 2,000 members

Revenue:
- 2,000 members × 59 THB = 118,000 THB
- Upsells: 2,000 members × 100 visits/year × 10 THB average = 2,000,000 THB
Total: 2,118,000 THB

Cost:
- 2,000 members × 100 visits × 6 THB (free dumpling cost) = 1,200,000 THB
- Fixed costs: 80,000 THB/month × 12 = 960,000 THB
Total: 2,160,000 THB

Year 1: -42,000 THB (small loss, acceptable for penetration)
```

**Phase 2: Retention + Upsell (Year 2)**
```
Goal: Retain 80%, upsell more

Revenue:
- 1,600 members × 59 THB = 94,400 THB
- Upsells increase: 1,600 × 120 visits × 15 THB = 2,880,000 THB (habit formed, buy more)
Total: 2,974,400 THB

Cost:
- 1,600 × 120 × 6 THB = 1,152,000 THB
- Fixed: 960,000 THB
Total: 2,112,000 THB

Year 2: +862,400 THB profit (profitable!)
```

**Phase 3: Price Increase (Year 3)**
```
Strategy: Raise membership to 99 THB (68% increase)

Members don't leave because:
- Habit formed (visit daily)
- Still cheaper than competitors
- Switching cost (lose accumulated habit)

Revenue:
- 1,600 members × 99 THB = 158,400 THB (+64,000 THB)
- Upsells: 2,880,000 THB (same as year 2)
Total: 3,038,400 THB

Profit: 3,038,400 - 2,112,000 = 926,400 THB/year
```

**Penetration Pricing Outcome:**
```
Year 1: -42,000 THB (invest in customer acquisition)
Year 2: +862,400 THB (profitable)
Year 3: +926,400 THB (raise prices, still profitable)

Total 3-year profit: 1,746,800 THB

If started at 99 THB:
- Fewer customers (maybe 500 instead of 2,000)
- Year 1: 500 × 99 THB = 49,500 THB (less revenue)
- 3-year total: ~500,000 THB (much lower!)

Penetration pricing 3.5x more profitable!
```

### Case Study 2: Charles House Flow Water (4 THB)

**From: dmarketing-trip.md**

**Market:**
```
Competitors:
- Generic water: 5-7 THB
- Branded water (Singha, Chang): 10-12 THB
- Premium imported: 30-80 THB
```

**Their Penetration Strategy:**
```
Price: 4 THB (20-40% CHEAPER than generic!)
Packaging: Looks like 80 THB wine bottle

Strategy:
1. Perception gap creates virality
   - "This looks 80 THB but costs 4 THB!"
   - Everyone talks about it (free marketing)

2. Grab market share through volume
   - Sell 1M+ bottles/month
   - Profit: 2.70 THB × 1M = 2.7M THB/month

3. Build brand awareness
   - Viral on TikTok (organic reach)
   - No advertising cost (penetration price = advertisement)
```

**Penetration Math:**
```
Traditional Strategy (15 THB):
- Volume: 100,000 bottles/month (high price limits buyers)
- Profit per bottle: 15 - 1.30 = 13.70 THB
- Total profit: 100,000 × 13.70 = 1,370,000 THB/month

Penetration Strategy (4 THB):
- Volume: 1,000,000 bottles/month (low price = high volume + viral)
- Profit per bottle: 4 - 1.30 = 2.70 THB
- Total profit: 1,000,000 × 2.70 = 2,700,000 THB/month

Penetration = 2x profit despite 80% price cut!
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Volume Economics:** 10x volume > 5x lower margin
- **Viral Marketing:** $0 advertising (perception gap = free publicity)
- **Barrier to Entry:** Competitors can't match (would lose money without scale)

### Case Study 3: Shopee (0% Commission)

**From: Reference in Thai documents**

**Market:**
```
Competitors:
- Amazon: 15% commission
- Lazada: 2-5% commission
```

**Shopee Penetration:**
```
Price: 0% commission (FREE!)
Subsidies: Free shipping (massive cost)

Phase 1 (2015-2018): Bleed money
- Cost: Hundreds of millions in subsidies
- Goal: Gain market share (network effects)

Phase 2 (2019-2021): Monetize ecosystem
- Still 0% commission
- Revenue from: Ads, logistics, payments
- Profit per seller: $50-200/month (not from commission)

Phase 3 (2022+): Adjust prices
- Introduce 2% commission (still cheaper than competitors)
- Sellers can't leave (already have customers/reviews/rankings)
- Buyers locked in (habit formed)
```

**Outcome:**
```
2015: 0 sellers, 0 buyers
2018: 1M sellers, 100M buyers (dominant in SEA)
2024: 5M+ sellers, 500M+ buyers (winner-takes-most)

Penetration pricing → Market dominance → Lock-in → Pricing power
```

## 👑 Skimming Pricing {#skimming}

### Definition

**Skimming Pricing = Start with HIGH price for early adopters, then gradually lower for mass market**

**Strategy:**
```
Phase 1: High price → Target early adopters (low volume, high margin)
Phase 2: Lower price → Expand to broader market
Phase 3: Mass market price → Volume sales
```

### When to Use

✅ **Perfect for:**
- **Innovative products** (iPhone, Tesla)
- **Luxury/Premium** (first-class, designer goods)
- **Technology** (new features before competition copies)
- **Limited supply** (scarcity + exclusivity)
- **R&D recovery** (need to recoup investment fast)

❌ **Avoid if:**
- Commodity market (customers won't pay premium)
- Need scale fast (network effects)
- Easy to copy (competitors undercut you)
- Mass market focus (need volume day 1)

### Skimming Price Curve

```
Price
  ↑
  |
  |  $1,000  ←─── Phase 1: Early Adopters (High price, low volume)
  |
  |    $700  ←─── Phase 2: Early Majority (Lower price, medium volume)
  |
  |      $400 ←─── Phase 3: Mass Market (Low price, high volume)
  |
  └──────────────────────────────────→ Time
     Launch    Year 1         Year 3
```

### Case Study 1: O'Leave (Quizzard App)

**From: dmarketing-trip.md**

**Market Positioning:**
```
Competitors:
- ChatGPT: $20/month (general AI)
- PhotoMath: Free basic, $10/month premium (math only)
```

**Skimming Strategy:**

**Phase 1: Launch (Skimming)**
```
Price: $9.99/week (!!!) or $70/year
Target: Desperate students (exams coming up)

Why students pay $40/month:
- Urgent need (homework due tomorrow)
- Higher perceived value (combines ChatGPT + PhotoMath)
- Early adopters (tech-savvy students)
- Pain point (failing class vs $40)

Revenue:
- 4M downloads × 10% conversion × $70/year = $28M potential
- Actual: $6M/year (still high!)
```

**Why Skimming Works Here:**
```
Early adopters (students who found app via TikTok):
- Willing to pay premium for:
  1. Convenience (photo upload vs typing)
  2. Accuracy (better than generic ChatGPT)
  3. Speed (homework answers in seconds)

Market segmentation:
- Top 10%: Will pay $40/month (desperate for help)
- Next 20%: Will pay $10/month (price-sensitive)
- Bottom 70%: Free users (won't pay)

Strategy: Capture top 10% at high price first (skim the cream)
Later: Lower to $19.99/month to capture next 20%
```

**If They Used Penetration Instead:**
```
Price: $2.99/month (low)
Customers: 30% conversion (high volume)
Revenue: 4M × 0.30 × $2.99 × 12 = $43M/year (potentially higher!)

BUT...
- Market perception: Cheap = low quality
- Harder to raise prices later (customers resist)
- Leaves money on table from early adopters (would pay $40)

Skimming → Capture max value from early adopters first
Then lower for mass market
```

### Case Study 2: iPhone (Classic Skimming)

**Apple's Playbook (2007-2024):**

**Phase 1: Launch (Year 1)**
```
Price: $599-$699 (flagship)
Target: Apple fans, tech enthusiasts
Volume: 1M units
Strategy: Skim early adopters who must have latest tech
```

**Phase 2: Expansion (Year 2)**
```
Price: $399-$499 (previous gen), $699-$799 (new flagship)
Target: Broader market (mainstream consumers)
Volume: 10M units
Strategy: Lower price on old model, introduce new premium
```

**Phase 3: Mass Market (Year 3+)**
```
Price: $199-$299 (2-gen old), $399-$499 (1-gen old), $799-$999 (new)
Target: Everyone (even budget buyers)
Volume: 50M+ units
Strategy: Tiered pricing (good-better-best)
```

**Skimming Benefits:**
```
Year 1: 1M units × $700 = $700M (high margin, skim early adopters)
Year 2: 10M units × $500 avg = $5B (expand market)
Year 3: 50M units × $400 avg = $20B (mass market)

Total: $25.7B over 3 years

If penetration pricing ($299 from day 1):
Year 1: 5M units × $299 = $1.5B (miss out on early adopter premium)
Year 2-3: Similar volume, but never captured high-end market

Skimming captures BOTH markets (early adopters + mass) at optimal price each phase
```

### Case Study 3: Tesla Model S → Model 3

**From: dmarketing-trip.md reference**

**Skimming Journey:**

**Phase 1: Model S (2012)**
```
Price: $80,000-$120,000
Target: Luxury buyers, tech enthusiasts
Volume: 10,000 units/year
Strategy: Prove EV can be premium (skim luxury market)
```

**Phase 2: Model 3 (2017)**
```
Price: $35,000-$50,000
Target: Mass market (Tesla for everyone)
Volume: 500,000 units/year
Strategy: Economies of scale (batteries cheaper, production streamlined)
```

**Why Skimming Worked:**
```
If Tesla launched Model 3 in 2012:
- Battery cost: $400/kWh (too expensive)
- $35,000 price = $10,000 loss per car
- Bankruptcy

Model S skimming:
- $100,000 price = $20,000 profit per car (funded R&D)
- 10,000 units × $20,000 = $200M profit
- Funded battery development
- 2017: Battery cost $150/kWh (affordable for Model 3)

Skimming = Fund innovation with early adopters → Then serve mass market
```

## ⚡ Dynamic Pricing {#dynamic}

### Definition

**Dynamic Pricing = Adjust prices in real-time based on demand, supply, time, or customer**

**Formula:**
```
Price = Base Price × Demand Multiplier × Supply Multiplier × Time Multiplier

Example (Uber):
Base = 50 THB
Demand multiplier = 2.0 (high demand)
Supply multiplier = 0.8 (many drivers available)
Time multiplier = 1.2 (peak hours)

Final Price = 50 × 2.0 × 0.8 × 1.2 = 96 THB
```

### When to Use

✅ **Perfect for:**
- **Fluctuating demand** (rides, flights, hotels)
- **Perishable inventory** (empty airplane seat = lost revenue forever)
- **Capacity constraints** (stadium seats, concert tickets)
- **Real-time markets** (stock trading, electricity)
- **Digital products** (can adjust instantly)

❌ **Avoid if:**
- Fixed price expectations (customers rebel)
- Simple product (water, rice - price changes feel unfair)
- Commodity market (competitors undercut)
- Brand perception (luxury brands = stable high prices)

### Dynamic Pricing Models

**1. Time-Based**
```
Price varies by time of day/week/year

Example (Movie Tickets):
- Weekday matinee: 100 THB (low demand)
- Weekday evening: 150 THB (moderate)
- Weekend evening: 200 THB (high demand)
- Holiday: 250 THB (peak demand)
```

**2. Demand-Based (Surge Pricing)**
```
Price increases when demand > supply

Example (Uber Surge):
Normal: 50 THB
1.5x: 75 THB (light surge)
2.0x: 100 THB (moderate surge)
3.0x: 150 THB (heavy surge)
5.0x: 250 THB (extreme surge)

Trigger: Ride requests / Available drivers > 2.0
```

**3. Segment-Based**
```
Different prices for different customer segments

Example (Airlines):
- Economy: 5,000 THB (price-sensitive)
- Business: 25,000 THB (convenience-seekers)
- First Class: 80,000 THB (luxury-seekers)

Same plane, different willingness to pay
```

**4. Inventory-Based**
```
Price drops as inventory fills (or increases if scarce)

Example (Hotels):
- 3 months out: 2,000 THB/night (early bird)
- 1 month out: 3,000 THB/night (standard)
- 1 week out: 2,500 THB/night (unsold rooms, drop price)
- 1 day out: 1,500 THB/night (desperate to fill)
- OR 5,000 THB if 90%+ full (scarcity premium)
```

### Case Study: Grab/Uber Surge Pricing

**From: Thai documents (Grab reference)**

**Problem:**
```
Peak hours (8am, 6pm):
- 10,000 ride requests
- 2,000 drivers available
- Ratio: 5:1 (demand:supply)

Without surge:
- Price: 50 THB (normal)
- Wait time: 30-60 minutes (terrible experience)
- Drivers don't want to work (traffic, same pay)
- Customers give up (churn)
```

**Solution (Surge Pricing):**
```
Surge multiplier:
- 5:1 ratio → 2.5x surge
- Price: 50 × 2.5 = 125 THB

Effects:
1. Demand side (riders):
   - Some riders delay trip (not urgent)
   - Some share rides (split cost)
   - Some use public transport
   → Demand drops from 10,000 to 6,000

2. Supply side (drivers):
   - Higher pay attracts more drivers
   - Off-duty drivers come online (2.5x pay!)
   - Drivers move to high-demand areas
   → Supply increases from 2,000 to 3,000

New ratio: 6,000 / 3,000 = 2:1 (balanced)
Wait time: 5-10 minutes (acceptable)
Surge drops to 1.3x automatically
```

**Revenue Impact:**
```
Without surge:
- 2,000 rides (supply-constrained)
- 2,000 × 50 THB = 100,000 THB
- Customer satisfaction: Low (long wait)

With surge:
- 3,000 rides (supply increased)
- 3,000 × 125 THB × 0.6 (after surge drops) = 225,000 THB
- Customer satisfaction: Higher (shorter wait)

Dynamic pricing = 2.25x revenue + better experience
```

**Why It Works:**
> **"Price is a signal that balances supply and demand in real-time."**

## 🆓 Freemium Pricing {#freemium}

### Definition

**Freemium = Free core product + Premium paid features**

**Formula:**
```
Revenue = (Total Users × Conversion Rate × Average Price)

Example:
- 1M free users
- 5% convert to paid
- $10/month average
Revenue = 1,000,000 × 0.05 × $10 × 12 = $6M/year
```

### When to Use

✅ **Perfect for:**
- **Digital products** (zero marginal cost per user)
- **Network effects** (more free users = more value)
- **Viral potential** (users invite friends)
- **Low switching cost** (easy to try)
- **SaaS/Software** (cloud-based, scalable)

❌ **Avoid if:**
- High marginal cost (each user costs you money)
- No network effects (free users don't attract paid users)
- Can't differentiate free vs paid clearly
- Profit margin too thin (can't subsidize free users)

### Freemium Conversion Ladder

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ Top 1%: Power Users ($100/mo)    │ ← Premium features, priority support
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│ Next 4%: Paid Users ($10/mo)     │ ← Essential features unlocked
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│ Next 15%: Active Free (daily)    │ ← Engaged, will convert eventually
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│ Next 30%: Casual Free (weekly)   │ ← Some engagement
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│ Bottom 50%: Inactive Free        │ ← No engagement, may churn
└──────────────────────────────────┘

Goal: Move users UP the ladder (from free → paid → power)
```

### Freemium Strategy Types

**1. Feature-Limited**
```
Free: Basic features
Paid: Advanced features

Example (Canva):
- Free: Basic templates, 1GB storage
- Paid ($13/mo): Premium templates, 100GB storage, brand kit

Conversion trigger: User needs premium template or runs out of storage
```

**2. Usage-Limited**
```
Free: Limited usage (per day/month)
Paid: Unlimited usage

Example (ChatGPT):
- Free: GPT-3.5, rate-limited
- Paid ($20/mo): GPT-4, unlimited

Conversion trigger: User hits rate limit (frustrated → upgrade)
```

**3. User-Limited**
```
Free: 1 user or small team
Paid: Multiple users

Example (Slack):
- Free: 10,000 message history
- Paid ($8/user/mo): Unlimited history

Conversion trigger: Team grows or needs more history
```

**4. Time-Limited (Free Trial)**
```
Free: Full features for X days
Paid: After trial ends

Example (Netflix):
- Free: 30 days full access
- Paid ($10/mo): After trial

Conversion trigger: Trial expires, user is hooked
```

### Case Study: O'Leave (Quizzard App)

**From: dmarketing-trip.md**

**Freemium Model:**
```
Free:
- 3 questions per day
- Basic AI (GPT-3.5)
- Photo upload

Paid ($9.99/week or $70/year):
- Unlimited questions
- Advanced AI (GPT-4)
- Step-by-step explanations
- Priority processing
```

**Conversion Funnel:**
```
4M downloads
│
├─ 2M active users (50% activation)
│
├─ 400K hit paywall (20% encounter limit)
│
├─ 80K start free trial (20% conversion to trial)
│
└─ 40K convert to paid (50% trial → paid)

Paid conversion: 40K / 2M = 2% (low but typical for freemium)
```

**Revenue Model:**
```
Free users: 1,960,000 × $0 = $0
Paid users: 40,000 × $70/year = $2.8M/year

But free users are valuable:
1. Network effect: Students share with classmates
2. Viral growth: Word of mouth
3. Data: Train AI on homework questions
4. Conversion potential: Will upgrade when desperate (exam season)

Lifetime value calculation:
- Free user: $0 today, but 5% convert eventually → $3.50 expected value
- Paid user: $70/year × 2 years average = $140 LTV
- Blended LTV: (1,960,000 × $3.50) + (40,000 × $140) = $12.46M total value
```

**Why Freemium Works:**
- **Low barrier to try** (free = easy decision)
- **Sticky product** (students get used to it)
- **Natural upgrade trigger** (exam urgency)
- **Network effects** (more students = more value)

### Case Study: Billiards Parlor (Free 40 Minutes)

**From: เทคนิคการตลาดแบบจีน.md**

**Freemium Twist (Physical Product):**
```
Membership: 449 THB/year
Benefit: Free 40 minutes play per day

Traditional:
- Pay-per-hour: 60 THB/hour
- Customer plays 1 hour, pays 60 THB, leaves
```

**Their Freemium:**
```
Free 40 minutes (membership)
→ Customer always plays 2-3 hours total!

Psychology:
1. Start playing (free 40 min)
2. Game gets exciting (competitive)
3. 40 minutes up → "Just one more game?" (sunk cost + fun)
4. Pay for extra time: 60 THB/hour

Average session:
- 40 min free + 80 min paid = 120 min total
- Revenue: 80 min × (60 THB / 60 min) = 80 THB
- Plus drinks/snacks: 50 THB
- Total per visit: 130 THB

Customer visits:
- 20 times/year (habit formed)
- Annual revenue: 449 THB (membership) + (20 × 130 THB) = 3,049 THB

Traditional model:
- 10 visits/year (no lock-in)
- 10 × 60 THB = 600 THB/year

Freemium (physical) = 5x revenue per customer!
```

**Key Insight:**
> **"Freemium works for physical products too. Give 'incomplete' experience free, upsell the 'complete' experience."**

## 📊 Tiered Pricing {#tiered}

### Definition

**Tiered Pricing = Offer multiple price levels (Good, Better, Best)**

**Structure:**
```
Tier 1 (Basic): $10/mo → Entry level
Tier 2 (Pro): $30/mo → Most popular (anchor)
Tier 3 (Enterprise): $100/mo → Premium

Goal: Segment customers by willingness to pay
```

### When to Use

✅ **Perfect for:**
- **SaaS/Software** (different feature sets)
- **Subscriptions** (Netflix, Spotify, gym)
- **Services** (consulting, agencies)
- **B2B** (small, medium, enterprise clients)

❌ **Avoid if:**
- Single customer segment (everyone has same needs)
- Confusing differentiation (customers don't understand tiers)
- Low-price commodity (customers just pick cheapest)

### Tiered Pricing Psychology

**The "Goldilocks Effect":**
```
Too Cheap ←───── Just Right ────→ Too Expensive
 (Basic)        (Pro) ⭐         (Enterprise)
  $10            $30              $100

Most customers choose middle tier (feels balanced)
```

**Revenue Optimization:**
```
Without tiers (single price $30):
- 100 customers × $30 = $3,000

With tiers:
- 20 buy Basic ($10) = $200
- 60 buy Pro ($30) = $1,800 (most popular)
- 20 buy Enterprise ($100) = $2,000
Total = $4,000 (33% more revenue!)

Tiered pricing captures willingness to pay across segments
```

### Good-Better-Best Framework

**Tier 1: Basic (Entry)**
```
Purpose: Lowest barrier to entry
Price: 30-50% of middle tier
Features: Core functionality only
Target: Price-sensitive, casual users

Example (Dumpling Shop):
- 59 THB/year
- 1 free dumpling per day
- No other benefits
```

**Tier 2: Pro (Anchor) ⭐**
```
Purpose: Most value, most popular
Price: 2-3x Basic tier (anchor point)
Features: All core + most premium features
Target: Majority of customers (60-70%)

Example (BBQ Restaurant):
- 495 THB/year
- 10 free beers + grilled fish
- Discounts on other items
- Access to tournaments
```

**Tier 3: Premium/Enterprise (Upsell)**
```
Purpose: Capture high-value customers
Price: 5-10x Basic tier
Features: Everything + VIP perks
Target: Power users, businesses (10-20%)

Example (Billiards Parlor):
- 4,000 THB/year (Manager status)
- Unlimited free play
- Private table reservations
- 10% commission on referrals
- Special tournaments
```

### Case Study: Dumpling Shop Tiered Membership

**From: เทคนิคการตลาดแบบจีน.md**

**Actual Tiers (Inferred):**
```
Tier 1: Basic Member (59 THB/year)
- 1 free dumpling per day
- Target: Students, budget-conscious

Tier 2: Gold Member (199 THB/year - hypothetical)
- 2 free dumplings per day
- 10% discount on extras
- Target: Regular visitors

Tier 3: VIP Member (499 THB/year - hypothetical)
- 3 free dumplings per day
- 20% discount
- Free drink
- Early access to new items
- Target: Daily visitors, food enthusiasts
```

**Revenue Model:**
```
2,000 members distribution:
- 1,400 Basic (70%) × 59 THB = 82,600 THB
- 400 Gold (20%) × 199 THB = 79,600 THB
- 200 VIP (10%) × 499 THB = 99,800 THB
Total membership: 262,000 THB

Plus upsells:
- Basic: 100 visits × 10 THB = 1,000 THB/year each
- Gold: 150 visits × 15 THB = 2,250 THB/year each
- VIP: 250 visits × 20 THB = 5,000 THB/year each

Total revenue per tier:
- Basic: 1,400 × (59 + 1,000) = 1,482,600 THB
- Gold: 400 × (199 + 2,250) = 979,600 THB
- VIP: 200 × (499 + 5,000) = 1,099,800 THB

Total: 3,562,000 THB/year

Single-tier (59 THB only):
- 2,000 × 59 THB = 118,000 THB
- Upsells: 2,000 × 1,000 THB = 2,000,000 THB
Total: 2,118,000 THB

Tiered pricing = 68% more revenue!
```

---

## 📦 Bundle Pricing {#bundle}

### Definition

**Bundle Pricing = Sell multiple products together at discount vs buying separately**

**Formula:**
```
Bundle Price < (Product A + Product B + Product C)

Example:
Product A alone: 100 THB
Product B alone: 150 THB
Product C alone: 100 THB
Total if separate: 350 THB

Bundle (A+B+C): 280 THB (20% discount)
```

### When to Use

✅ **Perfect for:**
- **Cross-sell** (customer needs multiple items)
- **Increase transaction size** (average order value)
- **Move slow inventory** (bundle fast seller + slow seller)
- **Simplify choice** (too many options = analysis paralysis)
- **Compete on value** (more perceived value than competitors)

❌ **Avoid if:**
- Cannibalizes high-margin products
- Confuses customers (too many bundles)
- Products don't complement each other

### Bundle Types

**1. Pure Bundle (All-or-Nothing)**
```
Only available as bundle, not sold separately

Example (Fast Food):
- Meal: Burger + Fries + Drink = 99 THB
- Cannot buy burger alone (forces bundle purchase)

Pro: Maximize bundle sales
Con: Customers who only want burger leave
```

**2. Mixed Bundle (Bundle + Individual)**
```
Both options available

Example (BBQ Restaurant):
- Membership + Benefits = 495 THB (bundle)
- OR pay per visit: 600 THB each time
- Membership = 17% discount if visit 1x, bigger discount if visit more

Pro: Flexibility (customers choose)
Con: Some customers cherry-pick (only buy high-value items separately)
```

**3. Cross-Sell Bundle**
```
Bundle complementary products

Example (Driving School):
- Driving lessons: 5,000 THB
- Insurance: 15,000 THB
- Car purchase consultation: Free
Bundle: 18,000 THB (save 2,000 THB)

Pro: Higher transaction value
Con: Some customers don't need all items
```

### Case Study: Massage Shop (Service Bundle)

**From: เทคนิคการตลาดแบบจีน.md**

**Individual Services:**
```
Foot massage: 300 THB
Thai massage: 500 THB
Oil massage: 600 THB
```

**Bundle Packages (Hypothetical):**
```
Package 1: Foot + Thai
- Individual: 300 + 500 = 800 THB
- Bundle: 650 THB (19% discount)

Package 2: Thai + Oil
- Individual: 500 + 600 = 1,100 THB
- Bundle: 900 THB (18% discount)

Package 3: Full Day Spa
- Foot + Thai + Oil = 1,400 THB individual
- Bundle: 1,000 THB (29% discount)
```

**Why Bundles Work:**
```
Customer A wants foot massage only:
- Sees Package 1 (Foot + Thai for 650 THB)
- Thinks: "For only 350 THB more, I get Thai massage too? (worth 500 THB!)"
- Upgrades to bundle (upsold!)

Revenue:
- Without bundle: 300 THB (foot only)
- With bundle: 650 THB (foot + Thai)
- Increased transaction: 117%

Cost:
- Foot massage cost: 100 THB (labor)
- Thai massage cost: 150 THB
- Total cost: 250 THB
- Bundle profit: 650 - 250 = 400 THB

Individual:
- Foot profit: 300 - 100 = 200 THB
- Bundle profit: 400 THB (2x profit!)
```

## 🔬 Pricing Research & Analysis {#research}

### How to Research Pricing

**Step 1: Competitor Analysis**
```
Questions:
- What do competitors charge?
- What features do they include?
- How do they position (premium/budget)?
- What's their pricing strategy?

Example:
- Competitor A: 500 THB (premium positioning)
- Competitor B: 200 THB (budget positioning)
- Competitor C: 350 THB (middle market)

Your positioning: 400 THB (value = premium quality at near-middle price)
```

**Step 2: Customer Willingness to Pay (Van Westendorp)**
```
Survey questions:
1. "At what price would this be TOO EXPENSIVE?" (Upper bound)
2. "At what price would this be TOO CHEAP?" (Quality concern)
3. "At what price would this be EXPENSIVE but still consider?" (Upper acceptable)
4. "At what price would this be a BARGAIN?" (Lower acceptable)

Results:
- Acceptable price range: 300-600 THB
- Optimal price: 450 THB (most answers cluster here)
- Avoid: Below 200 THB (looks cheap) or above 800 THB (too expensive)
```

**Step 3: Price Sensitivity Testing (A/B Test)**
```
Test different prices with small groups:

Group A: 399 THB → Conversion rate 15%
Group B: 499 THB → Conversion rate 12%
Group C: 599 THB → Conversion rate 8%

Revenue per 100 visitors:
- Group A: 100 × 0.15 × 399 = 5,985 THB
- Group B: 100 × 0.12 × 499 = 5,988 THB ⭐
- Group C: 100 × 0.08 × 599 = 4,792 THB

Optimal: 499 THB (highest revenue)
```

**Step 4: Conjoint Analysis (Feature Value)**
```
Question: "How much would you pay for each feature?"

Feature A (Fast delivery): +50 THB
Feature B (Premium packaging): +30 THB
Feature C (Warranty): +70 THB
Base product: 200 THB

Bundle all features: 200 + 50 + 30 + 70 = 350 THB
Actual willingness: 300 THB (20% lower than sum of parts)

Price: 320 THB (between 300-350, feels like good deal)
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes {#mistakes}

### Mistake 1: Cost-Plus Without Considering Value

**Wrong:**
```
Cost: 100 THB
Markup: 50%
Price: 150 THB

Customer value: 500 THB
→ Left 350 THB on table!
```

**Right:**
```
Cost: 100 THB
Customer value: 500 THB
Price: 400 THB (80% of value, still feels like good deal)
Profit: 300 THB (3x more than cost-plus!)
```

---

### Mistake 2: Penetration Pricing Without Exit Strategy

**Wrong:**
```
Launch at 59 THB (very low)
Year 2: Try to raise to 199 THB
Customers: "What?! 237% increase! I'm leaving!"
→ Churn spike
```

**Right:**
```
Launch at 59 THB (penetration)
Year 1: Build habit + loyalty
Year 2: Raise to 79 THB (34% increase, gradual)
Year 3: Raise to 99 THB (25% increase)
→ Smooth transition, low churn
```

---

### Mistake 3: Too Many Tiers (Analysis Paralysis)

**Wrong:**
```
8 pricing tiers: Basic, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Elite, Ultimate
→ Customers confused, can't decide, leave
```

**Right:**
```
3 tiers: Basic ($10), Pro ($30), Enterprise ($100)
→ Clear choice, most pick Pro (anchor)
```

### Mistake 4: Freemium With No Clear Upgrade Path

**Wrong:**
```
Free: Everything except Feature X (obscure feature no one needs)
Paid: Feature X
→ No one upgrades (free is good enough)
```

**Right:**
```
Free: Core features, limited usage (3 questions/day)
Paid: Unlimited usage + advanced features
→ Power users hit limit → Upgrade
```

### Mistake 5: Dynamic Pricing Without Transparency

**Wrong:**
```
Customer A sees: 100 THB
Customer B sees: 150 THB (same product, same time)
→ Customer B finds out → Feels cheated → Backlash
```

**Right:**
```
Transparent surge: "Demand is high, price 1.5x (75 THB → 112 THB)"
→ Customer understands → Accepts or waits → No backlash
```

## 🎯 Final Takeaways

### Key Principles

1. **Pricing = Strategy, Not Math**
   - Don't just add margin to cost
   - Think about goals (share, profit, positioning)

2. **Customer Value > Your Cost**
   - Charge based on value delivered, not cost incurred
   - iPhone: Costs $500, sells $1,000 (value-based)

3. **Segment Customers**
   - Different customers, different willingness to pay
   - Tiered pricing captures all segments

4. **Test Before Committing**
   - A/B test prices
   - Van Westendorp survey
   - Don't guess!

5. **Penetration vs Skimming = Growth vs Profit**
   - Penetration: Fast growth, low margin
   - Skimming: Slow growth, high margin
   - Choose based on goals

6. **Freemium = Scale First, Monetize Later**
   - Digital products only (zero marginal cost)
   - Need viral growth + network effects

7. **Dynamic Pricing = Supply & Demand Balance**
   - Perfect for fluctuating markets
   - Requires transparency (no backlash)

1. **Audit current pricing:** Which strategy are you using? (Cost-plus? Competitive? Value-based?)

2. **Calculate customer value:** What outcome do you deliver? What's it worth?

3. **Research willingness to pay:** Survey, A/B test, competitor analysis

4. **Choose strategy:** Based on goals (share, profit, positioning)

5. **Test & iterate:** Don't set-and-forget. Prices evolve.
