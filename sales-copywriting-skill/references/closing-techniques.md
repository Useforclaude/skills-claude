## Part 1: Assumptive Closes

### Close #1: The Assumptive Close (Classic)

**Principle:** Assume they're buying, skip to implementation details.

**How to Use:**
Instead of asking "Do you want to buy?" ask "Which option works best for you?"

**Examples:**
- "Which payment option works best—one-pay or 3-month plan?"
- "Should we get you started today or Monday?"
- "What email should I send the access details to?"
- "Would you prefer immediate access or scheduled delivery?"

**When to Use:**
- After strong interest is shown
- When they've engaged deeply with your content
- At the end of a sales call/presentation

**Script:**
```
"Great! So it sounds like this is exactly what you need. Let's get you set up.

Which works better for you:
- Option A: [DESCRIPTION]
- Option B: [DESCRIPTION]

Also, what email should I send your login details to?"
```

---

### Close #2: The Alternative Close

**Principle:** Give two "yes" options (never yes/no).

**How to Use:**
Present two choices that both lead to a sale.

**Examples:**
- "Do you want the basic package or the premium?"
- "Should we start with the 3-month or 6-month program?"
- "Would you prefer morning or afternoon delivery?"
- "Silver tier or Gold tier?"

**When to Use:**
- When they're interested but hesitant to commit
- To move past indecision
- To guide them to the better option

**Script:**
```
"Based on what you've told me, I think either the [OPTION A] or [OPTION B] would work great for you.

[OPTION A] is perfect if [SCENARIO].
[OPTION B] is ideal if [SCENARIO].

Which aligns better with your goals?"
```

**Pro Tip:** Present the option you WANT them to choose second (recency bias).

---

### Close #3: The Order Form Close

**Principle:** Start filling out the order while talking to them.

**How to Use:**
As you discuss the offer, begin filling in their details.

**Script:**
```
"Let me grab your information so we can get you set up...

What's the best email address for your account?
[Write it down]

And your phone number in case we need to reach you?
[Write it down]

Perfect. Now, for payment, are you using a credit card or bank transfer?"
```

**Psychology:** Creates momentum and commitment (they're already "in process").

**When to Use:**
- In-person or phone sales
- When they're engaged and positive
- After addressing all objections

---

### Close #4: The Secondary Question Close

**Principle:** Ask about a minor detail instead of the main decision.

**How to Use:**
Skip "Do you want to buy?" and ask about delivery, preferences, or implementation.

**Examples:**
- "Would you like this shipped to your home or office?"
- "Should we set up your account with your personal or business email?"
- "Do you want access to the bonus materials immediately or after Module 1?"

**Script:**
```
[After presenting offer]

"Quick question: When you get access, are you planning to start immediately or schedule it for next week?

We can set up your account either way."
```

**Psychology:** Answering the small question = implicit "yes" to the big question.

---

## Part 2: Scarcity/Urgency Closes

### Close #5: The Scarcity Close

**Principle:** Limited availability creates urgency.

**How to Use:**
Explain why supply is limited (must be TRUE).

**Examples:**
- "We only have 7 spots left in this cohort because we cap enrollment at 50."
- "There are only 3 VIP packages available because I personally work with each client."
- "This is a limited-edition offer—once it's gone, it's gone."

**Script:**
```
"I want to be upfront with you: We only have [NUMBER] spots available for [REASON].

Right now, [NUMBER] are left.

I'm not saying this to pressure you, but if you want in, you need to decide soon. Once they're gone, the next opportunity isn't until [TIMEFRAME].

Shall I reserve your spot?"
```

**Critical Rules:**
- ✅ Only use if scarcity is REAL
- ✅ Explain WHY it's scarce
- ❌ Never fake scarcity (kills trust)

---

### Close #6: The Deadline Close

**Principle:** Time-limited offer creates urgency.

**How to Use:**
Set a firm deadline and stick to it.

**Examples:**
- "This pricing expires Friday at midnight."
- "Enrollment closes in 48 hours."
- "The bonus package is only available if you join today."

**Script:**
```
"Here's the situation: This offer closes on [DATE] at [TIME].

After that:
- The price increases to [HIGHER PRICE]
- The bonuses go away
- [OTHER CHANGES]

You have [TIME REMAINING] to lock in the current deal.

I'd hate for you to miss out. Can we get you started now?"
```

**Why It Works:** Loss aversion (people fear missing out more than they desire gaining).

**Pro Tip:** Send countdown reminders (24 hours, 6 hours, 1 hour, 30 minutes).

---

### Close #7: The Penalty Close

**Principle:** Show what they lose by waiting.

**How to Use:**
Calculate the COST of inaction.

**Script:**
```
"Let me show you something:

Right now, you're [LOSING/MISSING] $[AMOUNT] per [TIMEFRAME] because of [PROBLEM].

If you start today:
- You fix this in [TIMEFRAME]
- You save/make $[AMOUNT]

If you wait 30 days:
- You lose another $[AMOUNT]
- You're 30 days further behind

Every day you wait costs you $[DAILY LOSS].

Can you afford to wait?"
```

**Psychology:** Makes inaction feel painful (which it is).

---

## Part 3: Logic-Based Closes

### Close #8: The Summary Close

**Principle:** Recap all value before asking for the sale.

**How to Use:**
List everything they're getting, show the value, reveal the price.

**Script:**
```
"Let me recap what you're getting:

Component 1: [VALUE $X]
Component 2: [VALUE $Y]
Component 3: [VALUE $Z]
Bonus 1: [VALUE $A]
Bonus 2: [VALUE $B]
Plus: [GUARANTEE]

Total value: $[TOTAL]
Your investment today: $[PRICE]

You're saving $[DIFFERENCE].

And it's backed by our [GUARANTEE], so you risk nothing.

Does that sound fair?"
```

**When to Use:**
- After long presentations
- When they've forgotten the full scope
- Before the final ask

---

### Close #9: The Ben Franklin Close

**Principle:** Pro/con list weighted toward buying.

**How to Use:**
Draw a line, list pros and cons together.

**Script:**
```
"Let's be logical about this. When Ben Franklin had a big decision, he'd make a list of pros and cons.

Let's do that:

REASONS TO JOIN:
✓ Solve [PROBLEM] permanently
✓ Make/save $[AMOUNT]
✓ Save [TIME]
✓ Get [BENEFIT]
✓ Get [BENEFIT]
✓ [10+ more reasons]
✓ 90-day guarantee (no risk)

REASONS NOT TO JOIN:
✗ $[PRICE] investment

Which side has more weight?"
```

**Psychology:** Appeals to logical thinkers; shows decision is obvious.

---

### Close #10: The ROI Close

**Principle:** Show the return on investment.

**How to Use:**
Calculate the financial benefit vs. cost.

**Script:**
```
"Let's look at this as an investment:

You invest: $[PRICE]
You get: $[RETURN] in [TIMEFRAME]

That's a [RATIO]:1 ROI.

Where else can you get that kind of return?

The stock market averages 8% per year. This is [PERCENTAGE]% in [TIMEFRAME].

It's not a cost—it's your best investment."
```

**When to Use:**
- B2B sales
- High-ticket offers
- Financial/analytical buyers

---

### Close #11: The Comparison Close

**Principle:** Compare to a more expensive alternative.

**How to Use:**
Show what else they could spend money on with worse results.

**Script:**
```
"Let me put this in perspective:

OPTION 1: Hire a [EXPERT] to do this for you
Cost: $[MUCH MORE]
Outcome: They do it once, you don't learn

OPTION 2: DIY with trial and error
Cost: $0 upfront, but [TIME] and $[OPPORTUNITY COST] in mistakes
Outcome: Maybe it works in [LONG TIMEFRAME]

OPTION 3: Our program
Cost: $[PRICE]
Outcome: You learn the system, implement in [SHORT TIMEFRAME], keep results forever

Which makes the most sense?"
```

---

## Part 4: Risk-Reversal Closes

### Close #12: The Puppy Dog Close

**Principle:** Let them try it risk-free (like taking a puppy home—they'll get attached).

**How to Use:**
Offer a trial or strong guarantee.

**Script:**
```
"Here's what I suggest:

Take it for [GUARANTEE PERIOD]. Use the entire system. Get results.

If you're not absolutely thrilled, get every penny back.

You literally can't lose.

And I'll bet that once you see the results, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.

Sound fair?"
```

**Psychology:** Removes risk, creates ownership mindset.

**When to Use:**
- High-ticket offers
- Skeptical buyers
- Competitive markets

---

### Close #13: The Guarantee Stack Close

**Principle:** Multiple guarantees remove all risk.

**How to Use:**
Offer 2-3 different guarantees.

**Script:**
```
"You're protected by our Triple Guarantee:

GUARANTEE #1: Results Guarantee
If you don't [SPECIFIC RESULT] in [TIMEFRAME], get a full refund.

GUARANTEE #2: Satisfaction Guarantee
If you're not satisfied for ANY reason in [TIMEFRAME], get a full refund.

GUARANTEE #3: Support Guarantee
If we don't respond to your questions within 24 hours, your next month is free.

You risk NOTHING. We risk EVERYTHING.

That's how confident we are. Ready to start?"
```

---

### Close #14: The "Prove Me Wrong" Close

**Principle:** Challenge them to find fault with the offer.

**How to Use:**
Confidently invite scrutiny.

**Script:**
```
"Look, I'm so confident this will work for you that I want you to try to prove me wrong.

Use it for [TIMEFRAME]. Give it your best shot. If it doesn't deliver [RESULT], I'll give you a full refund AND [BONUS] for wasting your time.

I'm betting on you succeeding. Are you willing to bet on yourself?"
```

---

## Part 5: Question-Based Closes

### Close #15: The 3-Question Close

**Principle:** Three questions that lead to an inevitable "yes."

**The Questions:**
1. "What's your biggest challenge with [TOPIC]?" (Identify pain)
2. "What have you tried so far?" (Show failed solutions)
3. "If you could wave a magic wand and fix this instantly, what would that look like?" (Dream outcome)

**Script:**
```
[After asking the 3 questions]

"Okay, so you want [THEIR DREAM OUTCOME], but [CURRENT SOLUTIONS] haven't worked.

That's EXACTLY what this solves. It gets you [DREAM OUTCOME] without [PAIN POINTS].

Based on what you've told me, this is a perfect fit. Shall we get you started?"
```

**Psychology:** Their own answers sell them.

---

### Close #16: The Isolating Objection Close

**Principle:** Identify and eliminate the ONE thing holding them back.

**Script:**
```
"I can tell you're interested but something's holding you back.

Can I ask: If we could address [SUSPECTED OBJECTION], would you move forward today?"

[If yes:]
"Great! Let me address that: [HANDLE OBJECTION]

Now that that's resolved, are you ready to start?"

[If no:]
"Okay, so what IS the concern? Let's talk about it."

[Address the real objection, then close]
```

---

### Close #17: The "What's Stopping You?" Close

**Principle:** Direct question that reveals the real objection.

**Script:**
```
"You've seen the offer. You know the value. You understand the guarantee.

So let me ask directly: What's stopping you from saying yes right now?"

[Listen—they'll tell you exactly what to address]

[Handle that objection, then:]

"Now that we've addressed [OBJECTION], is there anything else, or are you ready to move forward?"
```

**When to Use:**
- When you sense hesitation but don't know why
- After a full presentation
- With analytical buyers

---

### Close #18: The "Magic Wand" Close

**Principle:** Uncover their ideal outcome, then show you provide it.

**Script:**
```
"Let me ask you something: If I had a magic wand and could give you EXACTLY what you want regarding [TOPIC], what would that look like?"

[Listen carefully]

"Okay, so you want [REPEAT THEIR ANSWER].

Here's the thing: I might not have a magic wand, but this program delivers exactly that.

Here's how: [SHOW HOW YOUR OFFER MATCHES THEIR DESIRED OUTCOME]

Sound like what you're looking for?"
```

---

## Part 6: Advanced Closing Techniques

### Close #19: The Takeaway Close

**Principle:** Make it harder to get (reverse psychology).

**How to Use:**
Qualify them out, make them prove they're worthy.

**Script:**
```
"Before we move forward, I need to be honest: This isn't for everyone.

It's NOT for:
- People looking for a magic button
- Those unwilling to do the work
- Anyone expecting overnight results without effort

It IS for:
- Committed action-takers
- People ready to invest in themselves
- Those willing to follow a proven system

So let me ask: Are you SURE you're ready for this?"
```

**Psychology:** People want what they can't have; creates desire through exclusivity.

**When to Use:**
- With "tire kickers"
- To create urgency
- To qualify serious buyers

---

### Close #20: The Sharp Angle Close

**Principle:** Answer a request with a conditional commitment.

**How to Use:**
When they ask for a concession, tie it to an immediate decision.

**Script:**
```
[They ask: "Can you throw in [BONUS]?" or "Can you do better on price?"]

"If I can [DO WHAT THEY ASKED], can you move forward right now?

[If yes:]
"Okay, here's what I can do: [OFFER SMALL CONCESSION]. But I need your commitment today. Deal?"

[If no:]
"Okay, so it's not really about [THEIR REQUEST]. What's the real concern?"
```

---

### Close #21: The Reverse Close

**Principle:** Ask them to convince YOU they're a good fit.

**How to Use:**
Flip the script; make them sell you on why they should be accepted.

**Script:**
```
"I want to make sure this is the right fit. We only work with people who are [IDEAL CLIENT QUALITIES].

Tell me: Why do you think this program is right for you?"

[Listen]

"And are you committed to [DOING THE WORK]?"

[If yes:]
"Okay, I think you'd be a great fit. Let's get you started."
```

**Psychology:** Increases buy-in; they're selling themselves.

---

### Close #22: The Story Close

**Principle:** Tell a transformation story that mirrors their situation.

**How to Use:**
Share a case study that ends with a buying decision.

**Script:**
```
"You remind me of [CLIENT NAME].

She was in your exact situation: [DESCRIBE SIMILAR PROBLEM].

She was hesitant to invest because [SAME OBJECTION YOU'RE FACING].

But she decided to go for it anyway.

Within [TIMEFRAME], she achieved [RESULT].

She told me, 'The only thing I regret is not starting sooner.'

You're at the same decision point she was. What are you going to choose?"
```

---

### Close #23: The Godfather Close

**Principle:** Make an offer so good they can't refuse.

**How to Use:**
Stack massive value, remove all risk, add incredible bonuses.

**Script:**
```
"I'm going to make you an offer I hope you can't refuse:

You get [CORE OFFER] (worth $[VALUE])
PLUS [BONUS 1] (worth $[VALUE])
PLUS [BONUS 2] (worth $[VALUE])
PLUS [BONUS 3] (worth $[VALUE])

Total value: $[HUGE NUMBER]

Your investment: Just $[PRICE]

And if you're not thrilled, you get every penny back within [GUARANTEE PERIOD].

I'm literally handing you [RESULT] on a silver platter.

The only way you lose is if you say no.

So what's it going to be?"
```

---

### Close #24: The Columbo Close

**Principle:** "Just one more thing..." (like the detective)

**How to Use:**
After they decline, add one more piece of information.

**Script:**
```
[They say no]

"I understand. Thanks for your time."

[Pause]

"Actually... just one more thing before you go:

[ADD NEW INFORMATION—case study, bonus, guarantee detail, etc.]

Does that change anything?"
```

**Psychology:** The "one more thing" feels casual, not salesy; often reveals the real objection.

---

### Close #25: The Negative Reverse Close

**Principle:** Tell them NOT to buy (paradoxically makes them want to).

**How to Use:**
List who this ISN'T for.

**Script:**
```
"You know what? Based on our conversation, I don't think this is right for you.

This is for people who [IDEAL CLIENT TRAITS].

It sounds like you're looking for [WHAT THEY SEEM TO WANT INSTEAD].

I'd hate to sell you something that's not a fit."

[Pause—most will push back and try to convince you they ARE a fit]

[If they do:]
"Okay, well if you're serious about [CRITERIA], then maybe it IS right for you. Are you committed to [ACTION]?"
```

**Psychology:** Reverse psychology; no one likes being told they can't have something.

**Caution:** Use sparingly; can backfire if not executed well.

---

## Closing Sequence: The Stack

**Advanced Strategy:** Use multiple closes in sequence.

**The 5-Close Stack:**

1. **Assumptive Close:** "Which option works best for you?"

2. **[If hesitation] Summary Close:** "Let me recap the value..."

3. **[If still hesitant] Puppy Dog Close:** "Try it risk-free for 90 days..."

4. **[If objection arises] Isolating Objection Close:** "Is [OBJECTION] the only thing stopping you?"

5. **[Final push] Takeaway Close:** "This might not be for you. Are you sure you're ready?"

**Script:**
```
"So which works better: one-pay or payment plan?" [Assumptive]

[If hesitation]
"Let me just recap what you're getting: [Summary Close]"

[If still hesitant]
"Look, you can try this for 90 days risk-free. If it doesn't work, get a full refund. [Puppy Dog]"

[If objection]
"I hear you. Is [OBJECTION] the only thing holding you back? [Isolating]"

[Final push]
"You know what, maybe this isn't for you. This is for people who are ready to [TAKE ACTION]. Are you that person? [Takeaway]"
```

## Closing Principles

### The 10 Commandments of Closing

1. **Always Be Closing (ABC):** Every part of your copy/conversation should move toward the sale.

2. **Assume the Sale:** Act as if they're buying, not if.

3. **Handle Objections First:** Address concerns before asking for the sale.

4. **Use Silence:** After asking for the sale, SHUT UP. First to speak loses.

5. **Ask Multiple Times:** Asking once isn't enough. Ask 3-7 times in different ways.

6. **Make It Easy:** Simplify the buying process. Remove friction.

7. **Create Urgency:** Give them a reason to act NOW, not later.

8. **Remove Risk:** Guarantees make closing easier.

9. **Use Social Proof:** "Join 10,000 others" is powerful.

10. **Be Confident:** If you don't believe in it, they won't either.

---

## The Ultimate Close: The Silent Close

**Technique:**
After presenting the offer, ask a closing question, then STOP TALKING.

**Script:**
```
"So, are you ready to get started?"

[SILENCE]

[Wait for them to respond—no matter how long it takes]
```

**Why It Works:**
- Creates pressure (uncomfortable silence)
- Forces them to commit or object
- First person to speak usually "loses"

**Pro Tip:** This is the hardest close to execute because silence feels uncomfortable. Practice. Wait.
