Hey [First Name],

Yesterday, I sent you [Free Thing]. Hope you're finding it useful!

[TIME PERIOD] ago, I was exactly where you might be right now:

[DESCRIBE YOUR STRUGGLE - be specific and relatable]

I felt [EMOTION].

I'd tried [FAILED SOLUTION #1], [FAILED SOLUTION #2], and even [FAILED SOLUTION #3].

Nothing worked.

Then [TURNING POINT EVENT].

That's when I discovered [KEY INSIGHT].

I tested it. The results were [DESCRIBE RESULTS - with numbers if possible].

I couldn't believe it.

So I tested it again. And again. Same results.

That's when I realized: [BIGGER REALIZATION/MISSION].

And that's why I started [Your Business].

My mission is simple: [MISSION STATEMENT].

Over the next few days, I'm going to show you exactly how [YOUR METHOD] works—and how you can use it to [ACHIEVE RESULT].

Subject: The [Name] Framework that [Result]

Hey [First Name],

Quick question: What if I told you that [ACHIEVING GOAL] comes down to just [NUMBER] things?

Would you believe me?

Most people don't.

They think it's complicated. That you need [LONG LIST OF THINGS].

But after [YEARS/CLIENTS], I've discovered it's actually simple.

I call it: The [NAME] Framework

Here's how it works:

STEP 1: [ACTION]
[Brief explanation of what and why]

STEP 2: [ACTION]
[Brief explanation]

STEP 3: [ACTION]
[Brief explanation]

That's it.

[STEP 1] → [STEP 2] → [STEP 3] = [RESULT]

Now, I'll be honest: Simple doesn't mean easy.

You still have to [DO THE WORK]. But you're not doing it blindly anymore.

Let me show you how [CLIENT NAME] used this exact framework:

[MINI CASE STUDY - before, process, after with numbers]

The same framework. The same steps. Just [TIMEFRAME] of focused work.

You can do this too.

In fact, I've created a complete system that walks you through each step.

I'll tell you more about it tomorrow.

For now, think about this: If you could [ACHIEVE RESULT] in [TIMEFRAME] by following a proven system, would you do it?

Talk tomorrow,
[Your Name]

P.S. I'm curious: Which step do you think is your biggest challenge right now? [STEP 1], [STEP 2], or [STEP 3]? Hit reply and let me know.

### Email 4: Objection Crusher + Soft Pitch

**Template:**

Subject: The #1 reason [Goal] feels impossible (and how to fix it)

Hey [First Name],

Over the past few days, I've gotten a ton of replies from this list.

(Seriously, thank you! I read every single one.)

And the #1 thing people tell me is:

"[COMMON OBJECTION]"

I get it.

I felt the same way.

But here's what I've learned after working with [NUMBER] [TARGET CLIENTS]:

[OBJECTION] is usually not the real problem.

The real problem is [REFRAME OF THE OBJECTION].

Let me explain:

[STORY OR CASE STUDY showing someone who had same objection but overcame it]

[CLIENT NAME] said: "[QUOTE about their objection]"

But she decided to [TAKE ACTION] anyway.

Within [TIMEFRAME], she [ACHIEVED RESULT - with numbers].

Here's what she told me:

"[TESTIMONIAL QUOTE about how it wasn't as hard as she thought]"

See, [OBJECTION] feels big right now.

But once you have [SOLUTION/SYSTEM/METHOD], it becomes manageable.

That's exactly why I created [PRODUCT NAME]:

[BRIEF DESCRIPTION of what it is and how it solves their objection]

I'm opening enrollment [WHEN - tomorrow, next week, etc.].

If you're interested, reply with "YES" and I'll send you the details first.

Talk soon,
[Your Name]

P.S. Not ready to commit? No pressure. I'll keep sending you valuable free content either way. But if you ARE ready to [ACHIEVE GOAL], this is your chance.
