If you're [TARGET AUDIENCE] struggling with [PROBLEM], you're not alone.

Every day, [NUMBER] [PEOPLE LIKE THEM] wake up to [FRUSTRATING SITUATION].

They've tried [COMMON SOLUTION 1], [COMMON SOLUTION 2], and even [COMMON SOLUTION 3].

Nothing works.

Here's why: [BRIEF INSIGHT INTO WHY CURRENT SOLUTIONS FAIL].

But what if I told you there's a [DIFFERENT APPROACH] that [RESULT]?

It's already working for [NUMBER] [TARGET AUDIENCE] in [LOCATIONS/INDUSTRIES].

And in the next [TIME TO READ], I'm going to show you exactly how it works—and how you can use it to [ACHIEVE SPECIFIC OUTCOME].

```

**Example:**
```
If you're a coach or consultant struggling to get consistent clients, you're not alone.

Every day, 10,000+ talented professionals wake up to an empty inbox, no booked calls, and wondering where their next client will come from.

They've tried Facebook ads, cold outreach, and even posting daily on LinkedIn.

Nothing works consistently.

Here's why: You're using interruption-based tactics in a world that's tired of being interrupted.

But what if I told you there's an attraction-based system that brings qualified leads to YOU—without ads, without cold messaging, without spamming?

It's already working for 2,347 coaches and consultants in 34 countries.

And in the next 8 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly how it works—and how you can use it to book 15-30 sales calls per month with people who already want what you offer.

## Section 3: Problem Agitation

### Purpose:
Make the pain vivid and urgent.

### Formula:
1. Identify the problem clearly
2. Show the consequences (current pain)
3. Amplify the cost of inaction (future pain)

**Template:**
```
Here's the truth about [PROBLEM]:

Every day you don't fix this, you're losing [SPECIFIC LOSS - money, time, opportunities].

Let me break down what this is REALLY costing you:

❌ [SPECIFIC COST #1]
   (Example: $10,000/month in lost revenue)

❌ [SPECIFIC COST #2]
   (Example: 20 hours/week spent on tactics that don't work)

❌ [SPECIFIC COST #3]
   (Example: The confidence drain of posting content that gets ignored)

❌ [SPECIFIC COST #4]
   (Example: Watching competitors win clients that should be yours)

Add it up:
That's [TOTAL ANNUAL COST] per year.
That's [LIFETIME COST] over [TIMEFRAME].

And here's the worst part:

[EMOTIONAL COST - stress, shame, fear, missed dreams]

Does this sound familiar?

[Rhetorical question that they'll answer "yes" to]

If so, keep reading. Because there's a solution.
```

## Section 4: Solution Introduction

### Purpose:
Introduce your offer as THE answer.

### Formula:
1. Transition from problem to solution
2. Name your system/method
3. High-level overview of how it works

**Template:**
```
After [TIME PERIOD] of [RESEARCH/TESTING/EXPERIENCE], I discovered something that changed everything:

[THE KEY INSIGHT/BREAKTHROUGH]

I call it: [NAME OF YOUR SYSTEM/METHOD]

Here's how it works (in simple terms):

Instead of [OLD WAY], you [NEW WAY].

This allows you to [BENEFIT 1], [BENEFIT 2], and [BENEFIT 3] without [PAIN/EFFORT].

The result?

✓ [SPECIFIC OUTCOME #1]
✓ [SPECIFIC OUTCOME #2]
✓ [SPECIFIC OUTCOME #3]

And you can get started in as little as [SHORT TIMEFRAME].

Let me show you exactly what's inside...
```

**Example:**
```
After 7 years of testing every lead generation tactic known to marketers, I discovered something that changed everything:

People don't want to be sold to. But they LOVE to buy from people they know, like, and trust.

I call it: The Magnetic Authority System

Here's how it works (in simple terms):

Instead of chasing leads with ads and outreach, you attract them with strategic content and positioning.

This allows you to build authority, create trust, and generate inbound inquiries without spending on ads, without pushy sales tactics, and without burning out.

The result?

✓ 50-100+ qualified leads per month (on autopilot)
✓ Sales calls with people who already want to work with you
✓ A business that runs on attraction, not hustle

And you can get your first inbound lead in as little as 14 days.

Let me show you exactly what's inside...

**Template:**
```
But first, let me tell you why I created this...

[TIME PERIOD] ago, I was exactly where you are now.

I was [STRUGGLING WITH SAME PROBLEM]. I'd tried [FAILED SOLUTIONS], spent [MONEY/TIME WASTED], and had nothing to show for it.

I felt [EMOTION - frustrated, defeated, embarrassed].

Then [TURNING POINT EVENT].

That's when I discovered [KEY INSIGHT].

I tested it on [MYSELF/SMALL GROUP]. The results were [SHOCKING/INCREDIBLE/UNEXPECTED]:

[SPECIFIC RESULT - with numbers]

I couldn't believe it. So I tested it again. And again.

Same results.

Over the next [TIMEFRAME], I refined the system, worked with [NUMBER] [TARGET CLIENTS], and helped them achieve [COLLECTIVE RESULTS].

Today, I've [CURRENT SUCCESS METRICS - revenue, clients served, recognition, etc.].

But here's the thing:

I'm not sharing this to brag. I'm sharing it because I remember what it's like to [STRUGGLE].

And I want to help you skip the 7 years of trial-and-error I went through.

That's why I created [PRODUCT NAME].
