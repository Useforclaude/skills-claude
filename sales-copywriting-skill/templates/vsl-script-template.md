### MINUTES 0-2: Pattern Interrupt

**Purpose:** Stop the scroll, create intrigue

**On-Screen Text:**
```
[Provocative Statement or Question]

Example: "What I'm About to Show You Is Controversial..."
```

**Script:**
```
[VISUAL: Your face, close-up, serious expression]

Hi, I'm [YOUR NAME].

What I'm about to share with you is [CONTROVERSIAL/SHOCKING/LITTLE-KNOWN].

In fact, [INDUSTRY LEADERS/COMPETITORS/GURUS] don't want you to know this because [REASON].

But I think you deserve the truth.

So for the next [LENGTH] minutes, I'm going to show you [SPECIFIC PROMISE]:

→ [BENEFIT #1]
→ [BENEFIT #2]
→ [BENEFIT #3]

Now, before we go any further, let me be clear:

This is NOT for [WHO IT'S NOT FOR].

This IS for [WHO IT IS FOR].

If that's you, keep watching.

Because by the end of this presentation, you'll know exactly how to [ACHIEVE OUTCOME]—even if [LIMITING BELIEF].

Sound good? Let's dive in.

[TRANSITION]
```

**Example:**
```
Hi, I'm Sarah Chen.

What I'm about to share with you is controversial.

In fact, the big marketing agencies don't want you to know this because it could put them out of business.

But I think you deserve the truth.

So for the next 23 minutes, I'm going to show you how to generate 50+ qualified leads per month without spending a dime on ads:

→ No Facebook ads
→ No Google ads
→ No complicated funnels

Now, before we go any further, let me be clear:

This is NOT for people looking for a magic button.

This IS for coaches and consultants who are willing to show up consistently and provide real value.

If that's you, keep watching.

Because by the end of this presentation, you'll know exactly how to fill your pipeline with high-quality prospects—even if you've never done "marketing" before.

Sound good? Let's dive in.
```

### MINUTES 2-5: Problem Identification

**Purpose:** Show you understand their pain

**On-Screen Text:**
```
[Key pain points appearing one by one]
```

**Script:**
```
[VISUAL: B-roll of the problem - empty inbox, calendar with no appointments, etc.]

If you're a [TARGET AUDIENCE] struggling with [PROBLEM], I want you to know:

You're not broken.
You're not doing it wrong.
And you're definitely not alone.

Right now, [NUMBER] [PEOPLE LIKE THEM] are dealing with the exact same thing:

[PAIN POINT #1 - be specific]
[Pause for emphasis]

[PAIN POINT #2]
[Pause]

[PAIN POINT #3]
[Pause]

And here's the worst part:

[EMOTIONAL CONSEQUENCE]

Does this sound familiar?

[Rhetorical question they'll answer "yes" to]

Of course it does.

And let me guess: You've tried [COMMON SOLUTION], right?

Maybe even [ANOTHER COMMON SOLUTION].

How'd that work out for you?

[Pause]

I thought so.

Here's why those don't work...

[TRANSITION]
```

---

### MINUTES 5-8: Failed Solutions

**Purpose:** Dismantle alternatives, create urgency for new solution

**On-Screen Text:**
```
Why [Common Solution] Doesn't Work
```

**Script:**
```
[VISUAL: Screenshots or visuals of failed solutions]

You've probably been told:

"Just run Facebook ads!"
"Just post on social media!"
"Just do cold outreach!"

And maybe you've tried those things.

But here's what they don't tell you:

SOLUTION #1: [Facebook Ads / Paid Advertising]
- Costs $[AMOUNT] per month minimum
- Requires constant testing (aka: burning money)
- Stops working the moment you stop paying
- And with iOS updates, effectiveness is down [PERCENTAGE]%

SOLUTION #2: [Social Media Posting]
- Takes [TIME] per day to create content
- Algorithm changes kill your reach overnight
- You're competing with [MILLIONS] of other posts
- And most followers never buy

SOLUTION #3: [Cold Outreach]
- Feels pushy and salesy
- Gets [LOW PERCENTAGE]% response rate
- Damages your reputation
- And people are so tired of it, they auto-delete

Now, I'm not saying these CAN'T work.

But they're expensive, exhausting, and inconsistent.

There's a better way.

And I'm going to show it to you right now.

[TRANSITION]
```

### MINUTES 8-10: The Discovery

**Purpose:** Introduce your breakthrough moment

**On-Screen Text:**
```
The [Name of Your Method/Discovery]
```

**Script:**
```
[VISUAL: You talking, passionate and excited]

[TIME PERIOD] ago, I was exactly where you are.

I'd tried everything. Spent $[AMOUNT], wasted [TIME], got nowhere.

Then one day, [TURNING POINT EVENT].

That's when I realized: [KEY INSIGHT]

I tested this insight on [YOURSELF/SMALL GROUP].

The results were shocking:

[SPECIFIC RESULT with numbers]

I couldn't believe it.

So I tested it again. And again. Same results.

I started calling it "[NAME OF YOUR SYSTEM/METHOD]"

And here's how it works...

[TRANSITION]
```

**Example:**
```
3 years ago, I was exactly where you are.

I'd tried Facebook ads, Instagram posting, even hired a VA for cold outreach. Spent $47,000, wasted 18 months, got 3 clients total.

Then one day, I posted a simple case study on LinkedIn—not trying to sell anything, just sharing results.

Within 24 hours, 8 people messaged me asking to work with me.

That's when I realized: People don't want to be sold. They want to see proof.

I tested this insight by posting one case study per week for 30 days.

The results were shocking:

63 inbound inquiries
19 booked calls
11 new clients
$94,000 in revenue

I couldn't believe it.

So I tested it again. And again. Same results.

I started calling it "The Proof-Based Attraction Method"

And here's how it works...
```

### MINUTES 10-13: How It Works

**Purpose:** Show the process is simple and achievable

**On-Screen Text:**
```
The [X]-Step Process
[Each step appears as you explain it]
```

**Script:**
```
[VISUAL: Animated diagrams or step-by-step graphics]

[NAME OF SYSTEM] is based on a simple [NUMBER]-step framework:

STEP 1: [ACTION]
[VISUAL: Show this step]

[Explanation: What they do, why it works, how long it takes]

This is where [SPECIFIC BENEFIT].

STEP 2: [ACTION]
[VISUAL: Show this step]

[Explanation]

This is the part that [SPECIFIC BENEFIT].

STEP 3: [ACTION]
[VISUAL: Show this step]

[Explanation]

And this is where [SPECIFIC BENEFIT].

[Optional: Steps 4-5 if needed]

That's it.

No complicated tech.
No expensive tools.
No hours of work.

Just [TIME COMMITMENT] per [TIMEFRAME] and you'll start seeing [RESULT].

But don't just take my word for it.

Here's what happened when [NUMBER] [TARGET AUDIENCE] used this exact system...

[TRANSITION]
```

### MINUTES 13-16: Proof Stack

**Purpose:** Build undeniable credibility

**On-Screen Text:**
```

```

**Script:**
```
[VISUAL: Testimonial screenshots, videos, or case study graphics]

Meet [CLIENT #1 NAME]:

[Before state]
[After state - with specific numbers]
[Timeframe]

Here's what [he/she] said:

[TESTIMONIAL QUOTE]

[VISUAL: Next testimonial]

Or [CLIENT #2 NAME]:

[Tell their story - different demographic or situation]

[TESTIMONIAL QUOTE]

[VISUAL: Next testimonial]

And [CLIENT #3 NAME]:

[Tell their story - skeptic who succeeded]

[TESTIMONIAL QUOTE]

In fact, here's what [NUMBER] clients have achieved:

[MONTAGE of results - quick cuts of different people/outcomes]

→ [CLIENT] made $[X] in [TIMEFRAME]
→ [CLIENT] got [Y] leads in [TIMEFRAME]
→ [CLIENT] went from [BEFORE] to [AFTER]
→ [Continue with 5-10 quick results]

These aren't outliers.

This is what happens when you [USE THE SYSTEM].

And you can get the same results.

Here's how...

[TRANSITION]
```

### MINUTES 16-20: The Offer

**Purpose:** Present the solution and show massive value

**On-Screen Text:**
```
Introducing: [Product Name]
```

**Script:**
```
[VISUAL: Product packaging/mockup]

[Components listed with values, adding up]

Total Value: $[BIG NUMBER]

Now, if you hired me to do this for you, I'd charge $[HUGE NUMBER].

If you tried to figure this out yourself, it would cost you [TIME] and $[OPPORTUNITY COST].

But you're not paying that.

Your investment today is just:

$[PRICE]

[Let that sink in - 3 second pause]

That's [PERCENTAGE]% off.

And here's why I'm offering it at this price:

[JUSTIFICATION - mission, want to help X people, etc.]

But there's one more thing...

[TRANSITION]
```
