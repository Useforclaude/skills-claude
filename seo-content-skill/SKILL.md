## üéØ SEO Fundamentals

### How Search Engines Work

**3-Step Process:**

**1. Crawling**
```
Google bots discover pages by:
- Following links
- Reading sitemaps
- Crawling known URLs regularly
```

**2. Indexing**
```
Google analyzes and stores content:
- Keywords used
- Content quality
- Page structure
- User experience signals
```

**3. Ranking**
```
When someone searches, Google ranks pages by:
- Relevance (does it match query?)
- Authority (is site trustworthy?)
- User experience (is page helpful?)
```

---

### Google Ranking Factors (200+)

**Top 10 Most Important:**

1. **Content Quality** - Comprehensive, accurate, helpful
2. **Backlinks** - Quality and quantity of links
3. **Search Intent Match** - Does content satisfy query?
4. **Page Speed** - Loads in under 3 seconds
5. **Mobile-Friendliness** - Responsive design
6. **Domain Authority** - Site reputation
7. **User Experience** - Easy to navigate
8. **Freshness** - Recently updated
9. **On-Page SEO** - Keywords, structure, meta tags
10. **Engagement Metrics** - CTR, dwell time, bounce rate

---

### SEO vs. User Experience

**Common Mistake:** Optimizing for Google, not humans

**Right Approach:**
```
1. Write for humans FIRST
2. Optimize for search engines SECOND
3. If conflict ‚Üí choose user experience
```

**Why?**
- Google's goal = satisfy users
- Good UX = longer dwell time, lower bounce rate
- Engagement signals = ranking factor

---

## üîë Keyword Research

### Keyword Research Process

**Step 1: Brainstorm Seed Keywords**
```
List 10-20 topics your audience searches for

Example (Fitness Coach):
- weight loss
- muscle building
- workout routines
- nutrition tips
- home workouts
```

**Step 2: Use Keyword Tools**
```
Tools:
- Google Keyword Planner (free)
- Ahrefs Keywords Explorer
- SEMrush Keyword Magic Tool
- Ubersuggest
- AnswerThePublic (questions)

Find:
- Related keywords
- Search volume
- Keyword difficulty
- Question variations
```

**Step 3: Analyze Metrics**
```
Key Metrics:

Search Volume:
- 0-100: Very low (niche)
- 100-1K: Low (long-tail)
- 1K-10K: Medium (good target)
- 10K-100K: High (competitive)
- 100K+: Very high (difficult)

Keyword Difficulty (0-100):
- 0-20: Easy (go for it!)
- 20-40: Medium (achievable)
- 40-60: Hard (need authority)
- 60-80: Very hard (long-term)
- 80-100: Extremely hard (years)

Recommendation:
Beginners: Target KD < 30
Intermediate: KD 30-50
Advanced: KD 50+
```

**Step 4: Check Search Intent**
```
Types of Intent:

1. Informational ("what is keto diet")
   ‚Üí Create: Blog post, guide

2. Navigational ("youtube login")
   ‚Üí Not worth targeting (brand specific)

3. Commercial ("best running shoes")
   ‚Üí Create: Comparison, review

4. Transactional ("buy protein powder")
   ‚Üí Create: Product page, offer
```

**Step 5: Select Target Keywords**
```
Criteria:
‚úÖ Relevant to your business
‚úÖ Search volume > 100/month
‚úÖ Keyword difficulty achievable
‚úÖ Commercial intent (if selling)
‚úÖ Not already ranking for it

Create list:
- Primary keyword (1 per page)
- Secondary keywords (2-3)
- LSI keywords (10-20 related terms)
```

---

### Keyword Types

**1. Short-Tail Keywords**
```
1-2 words
Example: "SEO"

Pros:
- High search volume
- Broad reach

Cons:
- Very competitive
- Unclear intent
- Low conversion
```

**2. Long-Tail Keywords**
```
3-6+ words
Example: "how to do keyword research for SEO"

Pros:
- Less competitive
- Clear intent
- Higher conversion
- Easier to rank

Cons:
- Lower search volume
- Need more content
```

**Recommendation:** Focus 80% on long-tail

---

### Keyword Mapping

**One Keyword Per Page Rule**

```
Don't:
‚ùå Multiple pages targeting "weight loss"
   (compete with yourself = keyword cannibalization)

Do:
‚úÖ Page 1: "weight loss for beginners"
‚úÖ Page 2: "weight loss for women over 40"
‚úÖ Page 3: "weight loss meal plan"
‚úÖ Page 4: "weight loss exercises at home"
```

**Keyword Map Template:**
```
| URL | Primary Keyword | Search Volume | KD | Status |
|-----|----------------|---------------|-------|--------|
| /keto-diet-guide | keto diet for beginners | 5,400 | 35 | Published |
| /keto-meal-plan | keto meal plan | 3,600 | 40 | Draft |
| /keto-recipes | easy keto recipes | 2,900 | 25 | Planned |
```

---

```

**Step 3: Match your content**
```
Example: "best coffee maker"

If you write a "What is a coffee maker" guide
‚Üí Won't rank (wrong intent)
```

---

‚úÖ No special characters

Good Examples:

‚ùå yoursite.com/category/subcategory/seo_tips
```

---

### Header Tags (H1-H6)

**Hierarchy:**
```
H1 (Page Title)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ H2 (Main Section)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ H3 (Subsection)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ H3 (Subsection)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ H2 (Main Section)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ H3 (Subsection)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ H4 (Detail)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ H3 (Subsection)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ H2 (Main Section)
```

**Best Practices:**
```
‚úÖ Only ONE H1 per page
‚úÖ H1 = Title tag (or very similar)
‚úÖ Include keywords in H2s
‚úÖ Logical hierarchy (don't skip levels)
‚úÖ Descriptive (not "Introduction", but "What is SEO?")
```

---

### Keyword Placement

**Where to Use Primary Keyword:**

1. ‚úÖ Title tag
2. ‚úÖ H1 heading
3. ‚úÖ First 100 words
4. ‚úÖ At least one H2 heading
5. ‚úÖ Image alt text (1-2 images)
6. ‚úÖ Meta description
7. ‚úÖ URL
8. ‚úÖ Naturally throughout body (2-5 times)

**Keyword Density:**
```
Old SEO: 2-3% keyword density
Modern SEO: No specific number

Focus on:
- Natural usage
- Synonyms and variations
- LSI keywords (related terms)
- Semantic relevance
```

**LSI Keywords (Latent Semantic Indexing):**
```
Primary: "SEO"

LSI keywords:
- search engine optimization
- rankings
- organic traffic
- backlinks
- on-page optimization
- SERP
- keyword research

Use throughout content naturally
```

---

### Image Optimization

**File Name:**
```
‚ùå IMG_1234.jpg
‚úÖ keyword-topic-description.jpg

Example:
‚úÖ seo-keyword-research-process.png
```

**Alt Text:**
```
Describe image + include keyword (if relevant)

Examples:
‚úÖ "Keyword research tool screenshot showing search volume data"
‚úÖ "Infographic explaining 4 types of search intent"
‚úÖ "Woman doing yoga at sunrise on beach"

‚ùå "image"
‚ùå "seo seo seo keyword keyword"
```

**Image Size:**
```
‚úÖ Compress before upload (TinyPNG, Squoosh)
‚úÖ Aim for < 100KB per image
‚úÖ Use WebP format (smaller + quality)
‚úÖ Lazy loading for below-fold images
```

---

### Internal Linking

**Why It Matters:**
- Helps Google discover pages
- Passes "link juice" (authority)
- Keeps users on site longer
- Establishes content hierarchy

**Best Practices:**
```
‚úÖ Link to 3-5 relevant pages per post
‚úÖ Use descriptive anchor text
   Good: "keyword research guide"
   Bad: "click here"
‚úÖ Link deep (not just homepage)
‚úÖ Update old posts with links to new content
‚úÖ Create topic clusters (hub and spoke model)
```

**Topic Cluster Example:**
```
Pillar Page (Hub):
‚îî‚îÄ "Complete SEO Guide"
    ‚îú‚îÄ "Keyword Research" (spoke)
    ‚îú‚îÄ "On-Page SEO" (spoke)
    ‚îú‚îÄ "Link Building" (spoke)
    ‚îî‚îÄ "Technical SEO" (spoke)
