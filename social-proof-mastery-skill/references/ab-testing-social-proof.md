## Part 1: A/B Testing Framework

### The Scientific Method for Social Proof

**Step 1: Hypothesis**
- What do you believe will happen?
- Why do you believe it?
- What metric will improve?

**Example:**
> "Adding customer photos to testimonials will increase conversion rate by 15% because visual proof is more credible than text alone."

---

**Step 2: Design Test**
- Control (current version)
- Variant (new version)
- One change at a time
- Statistically significant sample size

**Example:**
- Control: Text testimonial only
- Variant: Same testimonial + customer photo
- Sample: 10,000 visitors (5,000 each)

---

**Step 3: Run Test**
- Set duration (minimum 1 week)
- Ensure randomization
- Monitor for technical issues
- Don't peek early (wait for significance)

---

**Step 4: Analyze Results**
- Statistical significance (95% confidence minimum)
- Practical significance (is improvement meaningful?)
- Secondary metrics (did anything else change?)

---

**Step 5: Implement or Iterate**
- If clear winner → implement
- If no clear winner → new hypothesis
- If unexpected result → investigate why

---

**Step 6: Document and Learn**
- Record results
- Share learnings
- Build knowledge base
- Inform future tests

---

---

### Sample Size Calculator

**Minimum sample size formula:**

For 95% confidence and 80% power:
- **Baseline conversion:** 2%
- **Expected lift:** +20% (to 2.4%)
- **Sample needed:** ~25,000 visitors per variation

**Quick reference:**

| Baseline CR | Minimum Detectable Effect | Sample Needed (per variation) |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1% | 20% (to 1.2%) | ~50,000 |
| 2% | 20% (to 2.4%) | ~25,000 |
| 5% | 20% (to 6%) | ~10,000 |
| 10% | 20% (to 12%) | ~5,000 |

**Lower traffic?**
- Larger effects easier to detect
- Or extend test duration
- Or use Bayesian testing

---

### Test Duration

**Minimum duration:**
- 1 week (to account for weekly patterns)
- 2 weeks better (more robust)
- 1 business cycle if B2B

**Don't stop early:**
- Even if "winning" early
- Need statistical significance
- Weekend vs. weekday behavior differs

**When to stop:**
- Reached sample size AND
- Reached minimum duration AND
- Result is statistically significant

---

### Avoiding Common Testing Errors

**1. Testing too many things at once**
- ❌ Change headline + social proof + CTA color
- ✅ Change one thing at a time

**2. Stopping test too early**
- ❌ "Winning after 100 visitors!"
- ✅ Wait for statistical significance

**3. Ignoring external factors**
- ❌ Running test during Black Friday
- ✅ Account for seasonal effects

**4. Not testing long enough**
- ❌ 2-day test
- ✅ Minimum 1 week

**5. Testing without hypothesis**
- ❌ "Let's try adding testimonials"
- ✅ "Testimonials will increase conversion 15% because..."

---

## Part 4: Interpreting Results

### Statistical Significance

**What it means:**
- 95% confidence = 95% sure difference isn't random
- Standard in A/B testing

**How to check:**
- Most tools calculate automatically
- P-value < 0.05 = significant

**Example:**
```
Control: 2.0% conversion (5,000 visitors, 100 conversions)
Variant: 2.4% conversion (5,000 visitors, 120 conversions)
P-value: 0.03
Result: Statistically significant (p < 0.05)
```

**Conclusion:**
Variant wins

---

### Practical Significance

**Statistical significance ≠ Practical significance**

**Example:**
- Control: 2.00% conversion
- Variant: 2.01% conversion
- P-value: 0.04 (statistically significant)
- Lift: 0.5%

**Is 0.5% lift worth implementing?**
- Depends on volume
- 1,000,000 visitors = 100 extra conversions
- If conversion worth $100 = $10,000 extra revenue
- Might be worth it!

**Consider:**
- Revenue impact
- Implementation cost
- Maintenance burden

---

### Secondary Metrics

**Don't just look at conversion:**

**Test:** Adding video testimonials

**Primary metric:**
- Conversion rate: +15% ✅

**Secondary metrics:**
- Time on page: +45% ✅
- Bounce rate: -10% ✅
- Page load time: +2 seconds ❌
- Mobile conversion: -5% ❌

**Analysis:**
- Video helps desktop users
- Hurts mobile (slow load)
- Solution: Lazy load video or mobile-specific version

**Lesson:**
Check all metrics, not just primary

---

### Segmentation Analysis

**Overall result might hide segment differences:**

**Test:** Customer logos on homepage

**Overall:**
- Conversion: +5% (not significant)

**Segmented:**
- B2B visitors: +25% (significant) ✅
- B2C visitors: -5% (not significant)

**Insight:**
Logos work for B2B, not B2C
Solution: Show logos only to B2B traffic

---

### Winner, Loser, or Inconclusive

**Clear winner:**
- Statistically significant
- Practical significance
- Positive across segments
- No negative secondary effects

**Action:** Implement immediately

---

**Clear loser:**
- Significantly worse
- Or no difference but slower/more complex

**Action:** Discard, try new hypothesis

---

**Inconclusive:**
- Not statistically significant
- Or conflicting secondary metrics
- Or works for some segments only

**Action:**
- Run longer (if close to significance)
- Or segment and personalize
- Or try new variant

---
