6. That Helps Avoid Failure (stakes)
7. And Ends in Success (transformation)

### The 12 Brand Archetypes

## Final Thought

> "People don't buy the best products. They buy the ones they can understand the fastest." — Donald Miller

Your product might be amazing. But if you can't communicate that clearly and compellingly, it doesn't matter.

Story is how humans have communicated for 100,000 years. It's wired into our brains. It's how we make sense of the world.

Use it. Master it. Watch your brand transform.
