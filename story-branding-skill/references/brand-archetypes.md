# Brand Archetypes: The 12 Jungian Patterns

## Introduction

Carl Jung discovered that across all cultures and throughout history, certain character patterns repeat. These "archetypes" are wired into human consciousness. When a brand aligns with an archetype, it taps into deep psychological patterns that create instant recognition and emotional resonance.

**Key Insight:** Your brand archetype isn't about what you sell—it's about the role you play in your customer's story.

## Archetype Evolution

### As Your Brand Grows

- Delivering transformation

**Mature Phase:**
- May evolve to Ruler or Sage
- Industry leadership

**The Danger:** Losing your soul in growth

**The Solution:** Keep your founding archetype as secondary even as you evolve the primary

**Example: Apple**
- Founding: Outlaw (1984 ad, "Think Different")
- Growth: Creator (empowering creators)
- Mature: Magician + Creator (transformation through creation)
- Kept: Outlaw spirit as secondary (challenging norms)

### Maintaining Consistency

**The Archetype Audit:**

Quarterly, review:
- Website copy
- Social media posts
- Ads and campaigns
- Email sequences
- Customer service scripts
- Product descriptions
- Sales presentations

**Questions:**
1. Does this align with our archetype?
2. Would our archetype say it this way?
3. Are we drifting toward a different archetype?
4. Are we being consistent across channels?

**The Fix:**
Create an archetype checklist for all new content:
- [ ] Voice matches archetype
- [ ] Imagery reflects archetype
- [ ] Message aligns with archetype values
- [ ] Tone is consistent with archetype
