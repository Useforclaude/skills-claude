# Customer as Hero: Positioning Customer at Center

## The Fundamental Shift

**Traditional Marketing:** "Look how great WE are!"
**Story-Based Marketing:** "Look how great YOU can become!"

This isn't just semantics—it's a complete mental model shift that transforms how you communicate.

## Why Customer Must Be Hero

### The Narrative Truth
In every compelling story:
- Hero = Character who wants something and transforms
- Guide = Helper who has been there and shows the way

**Your customer is on a journey.** They're the protagonist of their own life story. Your brand is a guide they encounter who helps them succeed.

### The Psychological Reality
People don't wake up thinking about your brand. They wake up thinking about their problems, goals, and desires.

**When you make yourself the hero:**
- You're asking them to care about YOUR journey
- You're positioning as competitor for attention
- Two heroes create confusion

**When you make them the hero:**
- You're focusing on THEIR journey (which they already care about)
- You're positioning as helpful guide
- Clarity = conversion

## The Customer Hero Framework

### Their Journey, Not Yours

**Customer's Story Arc:**
1. **Ordinary World:** Their current situation
2. **Problem Arises:** Gap between where they are and where they want to be
3. **Meet Guide:** Your brand appears offering help
4. **Receive Plan:** Clear path forward
5. **Take Action:** Decision to move forward
6. **Face Challenges:** Obstacles along the way (you help overcome)
7. **Achieve Success:** Transformation complete
8. **Return Changed:** New identity, better life

**Your Role:** Guide in acts 3-6, catalyst for acts 7-8

### The Lens Shift

**Every piece of content, filter through: "Is this about us or them?"**

❌ "We're the leading provider of..."
✅ "You deserve tools that actually work..."

❌ "Our company was founded in 1995..."
✅ "For 25 years, we've helped people like you..."

❌ "We're passionate about excellence..."
✅ "You shouldn't settle for mediocre..."

## Common Mistakes (and Fixes)

### Mistake 1: Split Focus

**Error:** Trying to be both hero and guide

"We're the industry leader (hero) who helps you succeed (guide)."

**Fix:** Pick one. You're the guide.

"You're building something amazing. We provide the tools that make it possible."

### Mistake 2: Humble Brag

**Error:** Pretending to be customer-focused while actually talking about yourself

"We're so proud to have helped 10,000 customers achieve success."

**Fix:** Make it actually about them

"Join 10,000 business owners who've transformed their operations."

### Mistake 3: Vague Customer

**Error:** Generic "customer" without specificity

"Our customers love us."

**Fix:** Specific customer with specific story

"Sarah, a freelance designer, used to spend 15 hours a week on invoicing. Now it takes her 30 minutes."

### Mistake 4: Company Origin as Hero Story

**Error:** Telling your founding story as if you're the hero

"We started in a garage with a dream..."

**Fix:** Connect your origin to customer's journey

"We started because we experienced your frustration firsthand. When our founder spent $700 on glasses, he knew something was broken."

Does your About page answer:
- ❌ "Who are we and what have we done?"
- ✅ "Why do we exist and how do we help you?"

Read your email sequence. Would the customer say:
- ❌ "This company sure loves itself"
- ✅ "This company really gets me"

## Customer Hero in Different Contexts

### Sales Conversations

**Bad:**
"Let me tell you about our company and our product features..."

**Good:**
"Tell me about your current situation. What's working? What's frustrating? What would success look like?"
[Then position product as tool for their success]

### Social Media

**Bad:**
"We're excited to announce..."
"We're proud of..."
"Check out what we built..."

**Good:**
"You asked for this..."
"Imagine being able to..."

## The Customer Hero Checklist

Before publishing any content, ask:

✅ **Is the customer the subject of most sentences?**
✅ **Are we showing transformation, not just features?**
✅ **Do we position as guide, not hero?**
✅ **Are we specific about who the customer is?**
✅ **Do we show the customer's journey?**
✅ **Are we using "you/your" more than "we/our"?**
✅ **Would a customer say "this is about me"?**
✅ **Are we showing outcomes they care about?**

---

Remember: Your customer doesn't care about your hero's journey. They care about their own. Be the guide they need, not the hero they didn't ask for.
