# Values Storytelling: How to Communicate Values Through Stories

## Introduction

Most companies list values on their website. Few actually live them. Even fewer tell stories that make those values real. Values without stories are just corporate buzzwords. Stories without values are just entertainment. Together, they create meaning.

**Key Insight:** Values aren't what you say—they're what you do when it costs you something.

## Why Values Need Stories

### The Problem with Values Statements

**Typical Company Values Page:**
```
Our Values:
- Integrity
- Innovation
- Customer Focus
- Teamwork
- Excellence
```

**The Problem:**
- Generic (every company claims these)
- Abstract (what do they mean in practice?)
- Unbelievable (talk is cheap)
- Forgotten (no one remembers them)
- Unused (don't guide decisions)

### How Stories Fix This

**Stories Make Values:**
- **Specific:** Real examples vs. abstract concepts
- **Believable:** "This actually happened" vs. "We claim this"
- **Memorable:** Narratives stick; lists don't
- **Actionable:** Shows what values look like in practice
- **Differentiating:** Your stories are unique; your values might not be

**Example Transformation:**

**Before (Generic Value):**
```
Value: Customer First
"We put our customers at the center of everything we do."
```

**After (Value + Story):**
```
Value: Customer First

Last year, our biggest client—who represented 30% of our revenue—
asked us to add a feature that would have made our product worse
for everyone else.

We said no. We explained that while we valued their business,
we couldn't compromise the product for our broader customer base.
They threatened to leave. We held firm.

They stayed. Six months later, they thanked us. Our product
direction proved right, and they respected us for prioritizing
long-term value over short-term revenue.

That's what Customer First means to us: ALL customers, not just
the biggest checkbook.
```

**The Difference:**
- Specific situation
- Real stakes (30% of revenue)
- Hard choice made
- Outcome shown
- Principle clarified

## The Values Story Framework

### The Core Formula

**Value + Situation + Choice + Outcome + Lesson**

**1. Value**
What principle was being tested?

**2. Situation**
What happened that put the value to the test?

**3. Choice**
What decision did you face? What were the options?

**4. Outcome**
What happened as a result of your choice?

**5. Lesson**
What did this teach you about the value?

### Example: Patagonia "Don't Buy This Jacket"

**Value:** Environmental Responsibility

**Situation:**
Black Friday 2011. Biggest shopping day of the year. Perfect
opportunity to maximize sales.

**Choice:**
- Option A: Run typical Black Friday sale, push consumption
- Option B: Tell customers not to buy unless they need it

**Outcome:**
They ran a full-page New York Times ad: "Don't Buy This Jacket"
with environmental impact data. Asked customers to repair, not
replace.

Sales went UP, not down. Customers respected the authenticity.
Brand loyalty deepened.

**Lesson:**
When you stand for something bigger than profit, customers respond.
Environmental responsibility isn't marketing—it's operational.

## Types of Values Stories

### Type 1: Decision Stories

**Structure:** Faced with choice, we chose values over ease/profit

**When to Use:**
- You made a hard decision based on values
- You chose principle over profit
- You did the right thing despite cost

**Formula:**
```
We faced [difficult choice]. We could have [easy/profitable path],
but that would violate [value]. So we chose [harder path] because
[principle]. The result was [outcome]. We learned [lesson].
```

**Example: Zappos Customer Service**

**Value:** Customer Service Excellence

**Story:**
A woman called asking about returning shoes for her husband who
had died in a car accident. The Zappos rep expressed condolences,
immediately arranged a courier pickup (free), and sent flowers.

The rep didn't ask a manager. Company policy empowers all employees
to do what's right for customers. Cost? A few hundred dollars.
Value? Immeasurable.

The woman shared the story everywhere. It became legend. That's
worth more than any ad.

**What It Shows:**
- Empowerment to act on values
- Humanity over policy
- Trust in employees
- Customer service as care, not transaction

### Type 2: Crisis Stories

**Structure:** When tested by adversity, we held to our values

**When to Use:**
- You faced a crisis
- Pressure to compromise values
- You chose principle under duress

**Formula:**
```
When [crisis happened], the easy response would have been [take
shortcut]. But our value of [value] meant [what we had to do].
So we [difficult action]. It cost us [price], but we [outcome].
```

**Example: Johnson & Johnson Tylenol Crisis (1982)**

**Value:** Customer Safety First

**Story:**
Seven people died from cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules (product
tampering). J&J didn't know the scope—it could be one city or
nationwide.

Advisors said: "Wait. Investigate. Don't tank the product."
(Tylenol was 17% of company revenue.)

J&J recalled ALL Tylenol from ALL stores nationwide. 31 million
bottles. Cost: $100 million.

They didn't wait for proof of widespread tampering. They put
customer safety above profit.

Result? Trust deepened. Tylenol market share recovered and grew.
The recall became a business school case study in ethical leadership.

**What It Shows:**
- Values tested under maximum pressure
- Short-term cost for long-term trust
- Speed of response matters
- Doing right even when unclear

### Type 3: Origin Stories

**Structure:** This value comes from our founding experience

**When to Use:**
- Value is rooted in founder experience
- Personal story explains commitment
- You want to show deep history

**Formula:**
```
[Value] isn't just a word to us—it comes from [founder experience].
When [founder] [situation], they learned [lesson]. That's why we
[specific practice]. It's not policy. It's personal.
```

**Example: TOMS One-for-One**

**Value:** Giving Back

**Story:**
In 2006, founder Blake Mycoskie traveled to Argentina. He saw
children without shoes. They couldn't go to school. They got
injured and sick.

He couldn't unsee it. He decided: What if every pair sold gave
a pair to a child in need?

That experience—seeing those children—is why TOMS exists. Not
a marketing strategy added later. The giving IS the business.

Over 100 million pairs given. The model expanded to eyewear,
water, safe birth. All because Blake couldn't walk away from
those kids.

**What It Shows:**
- Value embedded in DNA
- Personal experience, not corporate decision
- Mission-first business model
- Sustained over time

### Type 4: Cultural Stories

**Structure:** Here's how we live this value day-to-day

**When to Use:**
- You want to show everyday practice
- You have internal cultural examples
- You want to demonstrate consistency

**Formula:**
```
You might think [value] is aspirational. But here's what it
looks like on a random [day of week] at our company: [specific
example]. This happens because [systems/culture]. It's how we
[impact].
```

**Example: Basecamp Work-Life Balance**

**Value:** Sustainable Work Culture

**Story:**
Every Wednesday, no meetings. Period. Called "Library Rules Day."
Work that requires deep focus, no interruptions.

Summer hours: 4-day work weeks from May-August. Full pay. Because
summer shouldn't be experienced through office windows.

One developer worked through lunch every day for a week. His
manager noticed and said, "What's going on? That's not sustainable."
They solved the workload issue. Manager praised for caring, not
penalized for missing a deadline.

That's not aspiration. That's Tuesday.

**What It Shows:**
- Systematic implementation of values

- Consistency in practice
- Results prove values work

### Type 5: Customer Stories

**Structure:** Our values benefited a customer in this way

**When to Use:**
- You want third-party validation
- Customer experienced your values
- You want to show impact

**Formula:**
```
[Customer name] came to us with [problem]. Most companies would
have [typical industry response]. But our value of [value] meant
we [different approach]. For [Customer], this meant [impact].
Here's what they said: [quote].
```

**Example: Nordstrom Tire Return**

**Value:** Customer Service Without Exception

**Story (Legend, but represents culture):**
Customer returned tires to Nordstrom. Nordstrom doesn't sell tires.
(Store was built on site of former tire shop.)

Employee accepted return. Gave full refund. No questions.

Legally, could have said no. Technically, could have said, "Not
our product." But value of customer service without exception
meant: Do what's right for the customer.

Story spread for decades. Became part of brand mythology. Every
employee knows it. Every customer knows what to expect.

**What It Shows:**
- Extreme commitment to value
- Empowerment to act
- Brand mythology created
- Expectations set

### Type 6: Sacrifice Stories

**Structure:** We gave up [benefit] to maintain [value]

**When to Use:**
- You turned down opportunity for values
- You made financial sacrifice
- You want to prove commitment

**Formula:**
```
We had an opportunity to [desirable thing], but it would require
[violating value]. So we walked away. Yes, it cost us [specific
cost]. But [value] isn't negotiable. [Why it was worth it].
```

**Example: REI #OptOutside**

**Value:** Outdoor Experience Over Consumerism

**Story:**
Black Friday: Biggest retail day of the year. REI sells outdoor
gear—perfect market.

2015: REI closed ALL stores on Black Friday. Paid employees to
stay home. Ran campaign: #OptOutside—go enjoy nature instead
of shopping.

Lost millions in Black Friday sales. Chose values over revenue.

Result? 1.4 billion social media impressions. 150+ organizations
joined. Brand loyalty skyrocketed. Long-term value far exceeded
one-day sales.

Now annual tradition. Employees love it. Customers respect it.
Competitors can't copy it (they need Black Friday revenue).

**What It Shows:**
- Significant financial sacrifice
- Values over short-term profit
- Cultural impact beyond business
- Sustainable competitive advantage

### Type 7: Founder Personal Stories

**Structure:** Our founder personally lived this value

**When to Use:**
- Founder example embodies value
- Personal vulnerability builds trust
- Humanizes leadership

**Formula:**
```
[Founder] faced [personal situation]. [Typical response] would
have been [one way]. But [founder] believes [value], so [what
they did instead]. [Impact on them personally]. That's why [value]
is embedded in our company.
```

**Example: Spanx CEO Giving $10M to Employees**

**Value:** Generosity / Employee Appreciation

**Story:**
When Sara Blakely sold majority stake in Spanx to Blackstone,
she became a billionaire.

She surprised employees with two first-class tickets to anywhere
in the world. Plus $10,000 cash. For EVERY employee.

She said: "I want to celebrate you and give you an amazing
experience together."

Employees cried. Some had never flown first class. Some had
never traveled abroad. She changed lives that day.

She didn't have to. After taxes, the payout took a meaningful
chunk from her proceeds. She chose to share the win.

**What It Shows:**
- Leader modeling generosity
- Sharing success with team
- Values with personal cost
- Creating life-changing moments

## Crafting Your Values Stories

### Step 1: Identify Your Real Values

Not aspirational—actual values demonstrated through behavior.

**Questions:**
- What do we do even when it costs us?
- What would we never compromise on?
- What do we celebrate?
- What makes us angry?
- What earns respect here?
- What do we fire people for?

**Real vs. Aspirational:**
- ❌ "Innovation" (you say) but you punish failure (you do)
- ✅ "Reliability" (you say) and you always deliver on time (you do)

### Step 2: Collect Values Stories

**Create a System:**

```
VALUES STORY TEMPLATE

Value: [Which value?]
Date: [When did this happen?]
People Involved: [Who?]
Situation: [What happened?]
Choice: [What decision was made?]
Why: [What motivated the choice?]
Cost: [What did it cost us?]
Outcome: [What resulted?]
Lesson: [What does this teach?]
Where to Use: [Internal/external/both]
```

**Sources:**
- Leadership decisions
- Employee actions
- Customer interactions
- Crisis responses
- Daily operations
- Hiring/firing decisions
- Product decisions

**Collection Methods:**
- Monthly values story meetings
- Slack channel for submissions
- Anonymous submission form
- Manager reports
- Customer feedback
- Annual reviews

### Step 3: Structure for Impact

**The Arc:**

**1. Opening:** Set the scene
- When, where, who
- Normal situation

**2. Inciting Incident:** What created the test?
- Problem emerged
- Choice required

**3. The Stakes:** What was at risk?
- Cost of values choice
- Pressure to compromise

**4. The Decision:** What did we choose?
- Specific action taken
- Why we chose it

**5. The Outcome:** What happened?
- Immediate result
- Longer-term impact

**6. The Lesson:** What does it mean?
- Value clarified
- Principle extracted

**Example Structure:**

```
[Opening]
"Last Tuesday, a customer called at 4:45 PM on Friday."

[Inciting Incident]
"They had a critical issue. Fixing it would take 3-4 hours.
Our policy says we support until 5 PM, but this would mean
working late on a Friday night."

[Stakes]
"Our value of work-life balance means we don't ask people to
work weekends. But our value of customer success means we don't
leave customers hanging."

[Decision]
"Sarah, our support lead, called the customer and three team
members. She said: 'I'm not requiring anyone to stay, but I'm
staying to fix this. Who wants to join?' All three volunteered."

[Outcome]
"They fixed it by 7:30 PM. Customer crisis averted. On Monday,
Sarah gave the team half-days. She modeled that going above and
beyond gets recognized and reciprocated."

[Lesson]
"Values sometimes tension. When they do, we don't compromise
either—we find creative solutions that honor both."
```
