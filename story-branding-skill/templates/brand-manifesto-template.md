## Example: Complete Manifesto

**PATAGONIA: BUILD THE BEST PRODUCT**

We're in business to save our home planet.

For too long, companies have put profit over planet. They've built products designed to break, to be replaced, to fill landfills. They've treated Earth's resources as infinite. They've ignored the consequences.

We reject this.

**We believe:**
• Quality over quantity
• Repair over replace
• Responsibility over profit
• Future generations over quarterly earnings

**We build products that last.** Not because it's more profitable (it's not), but because it's right. We encourage you to buy less. We'll repair your gear for free. We'll buy back your used Patagonia and resell it.

**We're not perfect.** Every product we make harms the planet. We're working to minimize that harm. We're transparent about our impact. We're constantly improving.

**We donate 1% of sales** to environmental organizations. We fight to protect public lands. We speak out on climate change. We use our business as a force for good.

**If you believe** business can save the planet, not destroy it—you belong here.

**If you're ready to buy less** and choose better—you're our people.

**Join us** in building a sustainable future. Buy only what you need. Make it last. Demand better from every company.

*The earth is now our only shareholder.*
