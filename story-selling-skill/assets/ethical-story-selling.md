# Ethical Story-Selling: Strong Standards for Honest Marketing

## THE ETHICAL IMPERATIVE

**Why This Matters:**

Story-selling is powerful. It bypasses logical resistance, creates emotional connection, and drives action.

That power comes with responsibility.

Unethical story-selling:
- Damages people who trust you
- Destroys your reputation
- Invites legal trouble
- Harms the industry
- Keeps you up at night

Ethical story-selling:
- Builds sustainable business
- Creates loyal customers
- Generates referrals
- Protects you legally
- Lets you sleep well

**The Standard:** Your stories should be SO TRUE that you'd happily prove every word in court.

- Invent testimonials
- Create composite characters
- Embellish or exaggerate events

**Always:**
- Tell true stories only
- Use real people (with permission)

## WHEN YOU'RE UNSURE

**Ask yourself:**

2. **The Parent Test:** "Would I be proud if my mom/dad saw this?"

3. **The Customer Test:** "If the customer doesn't get results, will they feel misled?"

4. **The Peer Test:** "Would respected peers in my industry approve?"

5. **The Sleep Test:** "Can I sleep well knowing I published this?"

**If NO to any → Don't publish**

## COMMON RATIONALIZATIONS (And Why They're Wrong)

### ❌ "Everyone else does it"
**Reality:** Others' unethical behavior doesn't justify yours. Stand out by being honest.

### ❌ "It's technically true"
**Reality:** Technically true but practically misleading is still dishonest.

### ❌ "People need to believe it's possible"
**Reality:** True belief comes from honest representation, not exaggeration.

### ❌ "I have to compete"
**Reality:** Ethical marketing can outperform unethical. Trust wins long-term.

### ❌ "No one will find out"
**Reality:** Lies eventually surface. The internet never forgets.

### ❌ "The disclaimer covers me"
**Reality:** Disclaimers don't excuse misleading claims.

### ❌ "I'm helping people"
**Reality:** False hope hurts more than it helps.
