## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Starting with the end** ("I made $100K, let me tell you how")
✅ **Starting with the struggle** ("I was broke and desperate...")

❌ **Vague timelines** ("eventually," "soon," "after a while")
✅ **Specific timelines** ("Week 3," "Month 2," "6 days later")

❌ **No emotion** (just facts and numbers)
✅ **Emotional journey** (how it FELT, not just what happened)

❌ **Perfect hero** (no failures shown)
✅ **Flawed human** (mistakes and struggles included)

❌ **Disconnected from offer** (story doesn't lead to product)
✅ **Natural bridge** (story creates desire for solution)

❌ **Too long** (loses attention)
✅ **Right length** (respects audience's time)

❌ **Boring opening** (slow start)
✅ **Hook immediately** (grab attention fast)

## FINAL QUESTION BEFORE PUBLISHING

- [ ] Feel understood?
- [ ] Believe the results are possible?
- [ ] Want what's being offered?
- [ ] Feel compelled to take action?
- [ ] Trust the storyteller?

**If yes to all five → PUBLISH**

**If no to any → REVISE**

Use this checklist every time. Make it a habit.

Great stories aren't written - they're edited.
