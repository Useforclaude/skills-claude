- "December 3rd, 2019, 6:15am. My alarm didn't go off. Because I didn't set one. Because I didn't need to. I was free."

---

### Hook 2: The Contrast
**Pattern:** "Most people [common approach]. I [opposite approach]. Here's what happened."

**Examples:**

## Story Body Templates

### Body 1: The Failed Attempts Framework
**Pattern:** "I tried [Method 1]. [Why it failed]. I tried [Method 2]. [Why it failed]. I tried [Method 3]. [Why it failed]. Then I tried [Method 4]. Here's what happened."

**Example:**
"I tried cold calling. Made 200 calls, got 3 meetings, closed zero deals. Wasted 40 hours.

I tried cold email. Sent 1,000 emails, got 12 responses, 1 call, zero deals. Another dead end.

I tried networking events. Went to 15 events, handed out 200 business cards, got 4 calls, zero deals. I was exhausted.

Then I tried inbound content. Posted daily on LinkedIn for 30 days. 47 people reached out. 12 became clients. $87K in revenue. I never cold-called again."

---

### Body 2: The Before-During-After Framework
**Pattern:** "BEFORE: [Specific struggling state]. DURING: [Transformation journey]. AFTER: [Specific thriving state]."

**Example:**
"BEFORE: I was making $4,200/month as a freelancer. Working 55 hours a week. Living paycheck to paycheck. I couldn't take vacations. I was one missed client away from disaster.

DURING: I joined a business coaching program. First month, I raised my prices 100%. Lost one client, kept four. Same revenue, 20% fewer hours. Month two, I fired three low-paying clients. Revenue dipped but hours dropped to 35/week. Month three, I replaced those clients with premium clients at 3x the price.

AFTER: Today, I make $28K/month. I work 25 hours a week. I have 8 clients paying $3,000-$5,000/month each. I took a month-long trip to Europe last year. My business ran without me."

### Body 3: The Week-by-Week Framework
**Pattern:** "Week 1: [Action + Result]. Week 2: [Action + Result]. Week 3: [Action + Result]. Week 4: [Action + Result]."

**Example:**
"Week 1: I implemented the pricing strategy. Raised my rate from $75/hour to $150/hour. Sent emails to all 6 clients. 5 said yes, 1 said no. Net: positive.

Week 2: I switched to value-based pricing. Pitched one client on a $5K project (used to be 40 hours at $75 = $3K). They said yes.

Week 3: I pitched 3 more clients. 2 said yes. $15K in commitments.

Week 4: I had more work than I could handle. Raised prices again. Turned down 2 prospects. Felt amazing.

Month 2: $22K revenue. Same work hours. Different business model."

## Transition Templates (Story to Offer)

### Transition 1: The Personal Investment
**Pattern:** "I spent [time/money] learning this so you don't have to. You can get it in [shorter time/less money]."

**Example:**
"I spent 3 years and $180K figuring this out. I hired 7 coaches. I took 12 courses. I made $100K in mistakes. I'm going to give you the shortcut. Everything I learned, distilled into 90 days. You don't need 3 years. You don't need $180K. You need the system that works."

---

### Transition 2: The Mission Statement
**Pattern:** "I'm sharing this because [reason]. I believe [conviction]. If you [situation], I want to [offer help]."

**Example:**
"I'm sharing this because I wasted 5 years doing it the hard way. I believe anyone can build a 6-figure consulting business in 12 months if they have the right system. If you're trading time for money and you're maxed out on time, I want to show you how to package your expertise and scale without hiring a team."

---

### Transition 3: The "What If" Bridge
**Pattern:** "What if [desired outcome] was possible? What if [limiting belief] wasn't true? What if [timeframe] from now, [future state]?"

**Example:**
"What if making $20K/month while working 20 hours a week was actually possible? What if you didn't need a huge team or a massive audience? What if 6 months from now, you were working 3 days a week and making more than you make now working 6 days? That's not fantasy. That's what my students do. Let me show you how."

## Objection-Handling Story Templates

### Objection Template 1: "I don't have time"
**Pattern:** "[Name] has [less time than prospect]. They said [same objection]. Here's what happened."

**Example:**
"Meet Jennifer. Single mom, three kids, works full-time as a nurse (12-hour shifts). When she said 'I don't have time,' I believed her - she literally had less free time than anyone I'd met. I asked: 'Do you have 30 minutes a day?' She said yes. That's all she needed. 30 minutes a day for 90 days. She built a $6K/month side income working 3.5 hours per week total."

---

### Objection Template 2: "Too expensive"
**Pattern:** "[Name] was in [worse financial situation]. Here's why they invested anyway and what happened."

**Example:**
"Marcus joined with $380 in his bank account. Three months behind on rent. Credit cards maxed. He couldn't 'afford' my $2K program. But he joined anyway on a payment plan. Week three, he made his first $3K. The investment paid for itself. Today, he makes $40K/month. He told me: 'I couldn't afford NOT to invest. Staying broke was more expensive than the program.'"

---

## Close Story Templates

### Close 1: The Two Paths
**Pattern:** "You have two paths. Path A: [Stay same]. Path B: [Take action]. One year from now, which path do you want to have taken?"

**Example:**
"You have two paths in front of you. Path A: You close this page. You keep doing what you've been doing. You work hard. You make some progress. But a year from now, you're still trading time for money. You're still maxed out. You're still stuck.

Path B: You join today. You implement the system. It's not always easy - you'll have challenges. But 90 days from now, you've had your first $10K month. Six months from now, you're at $20K-$30K/month. A year from now, you're working 25 hours a week making more than you made in 60.

Both paths require work. One keeps you stuck. One sets you free. Which do you choose?"

---

### Close 2: The Look Back
**Pattern:** "Imagine it's [future time]. You're [desired state]. You look back at today. What do you wish you'd done?"

**Example:**
"Imagine it's December 31st. You're reviewing your year. You're making $40K/month. You work 20 hours a week. You took 8 weeks of vacation. You're present with your family. You look back at today - the day you read this - and you think: 'That was the day everything changed. I'm so glad I said yes.'

That future is available. The question is: will you choose it?"

---

### Close 3: The Warning
**Pattern:** "Here's what happens if you don't [take action]: [Consequence]. I don't want that for you."

**Example:**
"Here's what happens if you don't change your business model: You'll keep working 60-hour weeks. You'll keep being stuck at $10K-$15K/month. You'll burn out. You'll resent your business. And in 3 years, you'll either quit or be miserable. I've seen it happen too many times. I don't want that for you. You're too talented to stay stuck."

But here's what I told Mike about Sarah: she wasn't failing at business - she was failing at picking the right business model. Mike listened. Mike succeeded. And guess what?
