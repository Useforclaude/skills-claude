# Objection Stories: Stories That Overcome Resistance

## The Power of Objection-Handling Stories

**Traditional Objection Handling:**
"I don't have time."
"Yes you do! It only takes 30 minutes a day!"
*Prospect feels defensive, resistance increases*

**Story-Based Objection Handling:**
"I don't have time."
"I hear you. Let me tell you about David. He's a surgeon - 60-hour weeks, on-call, two kids. He told me the exact same thing. But here's what he discovered..."
*Prospect leans in, resistance decreases*

**The Difference:**
- Traditional = arguing with them
- Story-based = showing them someone like them who overcame it

## The 15 Core Objections + Story Solutions

### Objection 1: "I don't have time"

**Story Framework:**

**Pattern:**
1. Introduce person with LESS time than prospect
2. Show they had same objection
3. Reveal time commitment (less than they think)
4. Show what they did (specific schedule)
5. Results despite time constraints
6. The insight about time

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about Jennifer. She's a single mom with three kids under 10, works full-time as an ER nurse (12-hour shifts), and volunteers at her kids' school. When she told me 'I don't have time,' I believed her - she literally had less free time than anyone I'd ever met.

I asked her: 'Do you have 30 minutes a day? Like during your lunch break or after the kids go to bed?' She said yes.

I told her: 'That's all you need. Commit to 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. That's it.'

She decided to wake up 30 minutes earlier - 5:30am instead of 6am. First week, she went through the foundation module. Week two, she implemented the first strategy during her lunch breaks. Week three, she saw her first result.

Three months in, she'd built a side income of $6K/month working 3.5 hours per week total. 30 minutes a day, 7 days a week.

She told me: 'I didn't need more time. I needed a system that fit the time I had.'

Here's what I learned from Jennifer: everyone has time. What they don't have is a system efficient enough to fit their time. This program is designed for busy people. You don't need 4 hours a day. You need 30 focused minutes."

**Deployment:**
- Use in emails when "too busy" objection likely
- Use in webinar during Q&A
- Use on sales page in FAQ section
- Use in sales calls when objection arises

### Objection 2: "I don't have money" / "Too expensive"

**Story Framework:**

**Pattern:**
1. Person in worse financial situation
2. Why they couldn't "afford" it
3. Why they invested anyway (what changed perspective)
4. How they made it back quickly
5. What it would have cost NOT to invest

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about Marcus. He joined my program with $380 in his bank account. He was three months behind on rent. His credit cards were maxed. His wife was working two jobs. He definitely couldn't 'afford' my $2K program.

But he joined anyway. He used a payment plan - $500 down, $500/month for 3 months.

I asked him later: 'How did you justify that when you were broke?' He said: 'I realized I couldn't afford NOT to do it. I'd been stuck at the same income for 3 years. If I didn't change something, I'd be having this same conversation next year. The question wasn't can I afford $2K - it was can I afford to stay where I am?'

Week one, he implemented the pricing strategy. He raised his freelance rate from $50/hour to $125/hour. He expected to lose clients. He lost one, kept six. Revenue up 120%.

Week three, he landed his first retainer client using the templates from module 4. $3K/month. He'd made back his investment.

Month two, he was making $12K/month - triple his previous income.

Today, he makes $40K/month. That $2K investment has generated over $400K in revenue.

He told me: 'Best money I ever spent. But more importantly, it taught me that investing in yourself when you're broke is exactly when you SHOULD invest - because that's when you're hungry enough to make it work.'

Here's the reality: this program costs $2K. You can either see that as an expense or as an investment. If you follow the system, you'll make it back. The only question is: can you afford to stay where you are?"

---

### Objection 3: "I'm not tech-savvy"

**Story Framework:**

**Pattern:**
1. Person with zero tech skills (be specific)
2. What they couldn't do (makes it relatable)
3. Why that didn't matter
4. How support helped them
5. Results despite tech limitations

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about Linda. She's 64 years old. When she joined my program, she couldn't attach a file to an email. I'm not joking. She'd been asking her grandson to help her with basic computer stuff.

She joined my course creation program. On day one, she posted in the Facebook group: 'I can't figure out how to join the Zoom call. Please help.' Someone walked her through it via phone.

Week one, she couldn't figure out how to screen-share. Community helped. Week two, she couldn't figure out how to upload to the course platform. Support team helped.

But here's what Linda DID do: she followed every step exactly. She didn't try to get fancy. She used the templates. She didn't deviate from the system.

Month three, she launched her first course - 'Retirement Planning for Teachers.' Filmed on her iPhone. Used the template landing page (just filled in the blanks). Made $8K on her first launch.

Month six, she'd made $32K. Month twelve, $85K.

She told me: 'I thought I needed to be tech-savvy to do this. Turns out, I just needed to follow directions and ask for help when stuck. The tech is the easy part - the system teaches you everything.'

Here's the truth: you don't need to be tech-savvy. You need to be coachable. Every tech step has a tutorial. Every question has been answered. The community helps. Support helps. You just need to be willing to learn."

### Objection 4: "I tried stuff like this before and it didn't work"

**Story Framework:**

**Pattern:**
1. Person who tried multiple competitors
2. Why those didn't work (specific reasons)
3. Why they were skeptical of yours
4. What was different (specific contrast)
5. Why THIS one worked

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about Tom. Before joining my program, he'd taken SEVEN other courses. Spent over $15K. None of them worked.

I asked him to list them. He did. I knew most of them - good programs. I asked: 'Why didn't they work?' He said: 'They taught me WHAT to do but not HOW to do it. They gave me frameworks and strategies, but when I tried to implement, I got stuck. No one was there to help. So I'd quit and try the next course.'

He joined my program skeptical as hell. He told me: 'I'm only trying this because my friend vouched for you. But I've been burned too many times.'

First week, he posted: 'I'm stuck on step 3 of module 2.' I responded within 2 hours with a video showing exactly what to do. He implemented. Moved forward.

Week two, stuck again. Posted. Got help. Kept moving.

Week three, he made his first $2K. He posted: 'Holy shit, this is actually working.'

Month three, he'd made $18K. More than he'd made total from the other seven courses.

I asked him: 'What was different?' He said: 'Three things: One, you give templates and scripts, not just concepts. Two, when I get stuck, I get actual help. Three, you hold me accountable - the weekly check-ins kept me going when I wanted to quit.'

Here's why this program works when others don't: it's not just information - it's implementation support. You get templates, scripts, examples, and access to me and the community. Getting stuck doesn't mean quitting. It means asking for help and moving forward."

---

### Objection 5: "What if it doesn't work for me?" / "I'm different"

**Story Framework:**

**Pattern:**
1. Person who had UNIQUE circumstance
2. All the reasons it "shouldn't" work for them
3. Why they tried anyway
4. How they adapted the system
5. Why the principles work across contexts

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about Rachel. She came to me and said: 'I love your program, but I don't think it'll work for me. I'm in a really specific niche - high-end dog training. Your examples are all B2B coaches and course creators. My audience is totally different.'

I told her: 'The tactics change. The principles don't. Try it.'

She joined, still skeptical. Module 2 was about value-based pricing. All the examples were consultants. She thought: 'This doesn't apply to dog training.' But she tried it anyway.

She'd been charging $100/session for dog training. Using the value framework, she created a premium package: $5K for a complete dog transformation program (8 weeks, behavior modification, guaranteed results).

She pitched it to one client. They said yes. She almost fainted.

Month two, she sold three more. $15K. In dog training.

Module 5 was about creating scalable offers. Again, all the examples were digital products. She thought: 'I can't scale dog training - it's 1-on-1 work.' But she applied the principle anyway.

She created a group training program: 6 dogs at once, same curriculum. Charged $2K per dog. $12K for the same time she used to charge $100.

Six months in, she'd made $94K. In dog training.

She told me: 'I was wrong. The niche doesn't matter. The principles work everywhere. I just needed to translate them to my context.'

Here's the reality: I've had students in 47 different industries use this system. Plumbers. Therapists. Photographers. Real estate agents. Coaches. The tactics look different, but the principles are universal. Stop telling yourself you're different. Apply the principles to your situation."

### Objection 6: "I need to think about it"

**Story Framework:**

**Pattern:**
1. Two people, same starting point
2. One joins immediately, one waits
3. Show parallel timelines
4. Contrast outcomes
5. Cost of waiting

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about two people who emailed me the same week in January 2023.

Person A - Sarah: She watched my webinar on Monday. Joined Tuesday. Started immediately.
Person B - Mike: He watched the same webinar. Said 'I need to think about it.' Joined 4 months later in May.

Let's compare their timelines:

Sarah:
- February: Finished modules, made first $4K
- March: Scaled to $12K
- April: $18K
- May: $24K
- June: $30K

Mike:
- February-April: Still 'thinking about it'
- May: Finally joined, started modules
- June: Made first $3K

By June, Sarah had made $88K. Mike had made $3K.

Same program. Same potential. Different decision speed.

I asked Mike later: 'What were you thinking about for 4 months?' He said: 'Honestly? I was scared. I was looking for a guarantee it would work. I was waiting to feel "ready." But you're never ready. I should have just started.'

Mike's doing great now - he's at $40K/month. But he lost 4 months of income because he waited. That's $100K+ he left on the table by 'thinking about it.'

Here's what I learned: 'thinking about it' is usually fear disguised as wisdom. You're not gathering new information - you're hoping the fear will go away. It won't. The fear goes away when you take action.

You know you need a change. You know this makes sense. The only question is: do you want to start now or wish you had 4 months from now?"

---

### Objection 7: "I don't have an audience" / "I need to build my list first"

**Story Framework:**

**Pattern:**
1. Person with tiny/no audience
2. They thought they needed to build first
3. Why that was wrong
4. What they did instead
5. How audience grew AS they built business

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about Kevin. When he joined my course creator program, he had 43 people on his email list. 43. No social media following. No reputation. Zero.

He said: 'Should I spend 6 months building my list before I launch a course?' I said: 'No. Launch to the 43. Build your list while you build your business.'

He thought I was crazy. But he trusted me.

He validated his course idea by surveying his 43 subscribers. 8 responded. 3 said they'd buy.

He created a simple landing page. Emailed his 43 people: 'I'm creating a course on [topic]. If you want it, pre-order for $200.'

5 people bought. Not the 3 who said they would - different 5. $1,000 revenue from 43 subscribers.

He created the course. Delivered to 5 beta students. Got testimonials.

He launched publicly. But he didn't have an audience, so he ran Facebook ads. Spent $300. Got 80 leads. 6 sales. $1,200 revenue.

He used that revenue to run more ads. Got 200 leads. His list was now at 323 people.

Launched again. 18 sales. $3,600.

By month 6, he had 2,000 subscribers and was making $15K/month.

He told me: 'I almost wasted 6 months building a list before launching. That would have been stupid. I built my list BY launching. The course marketing grew my audience faster than content ever could have.'

Here's the truth: you don't need a big audience to make money. You need a great offer. Kevin made $1K from 43 people. You probably have more than that. And if you don't? Facebook ads. LinkedIn. Guest podcasting. You can build audience and business simultaneously. Stop waiting. Start launching."

### Objection 8: "I'm not an expert" / "Who am I to teach this?"

**Story Framework:**

**Pattern:**
1. Person with minimal experience
2. Why they felt unqualified
3. Who they helped anyway
4. Why "2 steps ahead" is enough
5. Expertise is relative

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about Ashley. She'd been doing freelance writing for 18 months. Total newbie. Making about $3K/month. She wanted to create a course teaching beginners how to land clients.

She said: 'Who am I to teach this? I've only been doing it for 18 months. There are people with 10 years of experience.'

I asked her: 'Are there people with ZERO experience who want what you know?' She said: 'Well, yeah. Beginners.' I said: 'Then you're qualified. You're 2 steps ahead. That's all you need.'

She launched a course: 'Your First Freelance Writing Client in 30 Days.' She charged $200. Her target audience: people with zero clients.

First launch: 12 students. $2,400.

One student emailed her: 'This is exactly what I needed. All the other courses are from people who've been writing for 20 years. They've forgotten what it's like to be a beginner. You just did this. You remember the mistakes. You know what actually works NOW, not what worked 10 years ago.'

That email changed everything for Ashley. She realized: being NEW was her advantage, not her weakness.

Six months in, she'd made $40K teaching something she'd only been doing for 2 years.

She told me: 'I thought I needed to be the world's foremost expert. I just needed to be ahead of my student. And I was. 18 months is an eternity ahead of someone at day zero.'

Here's the truth: you don't need 20 years of experience. You need to have solved a problem someone else currently has. If you're 2 steps ahead of your target student, you're an expert to them. Stop comparing yourself to the top 1%. Compare yourself to your student. You're miles ahead."

---

### Objection 9: "The market is saturated" / "Too much competition"

**Story Framework:**

**Pattern:**
1. Person in "saturated" niche
2. Why they thought they had no chance
3. How they differentiated
4. Results despite competition
5. Why saturation = validation, not barrier

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about Maria. She wanted to be a life coach for women. I told her that's one of the most competitive niches online. She said: 'I know. Should I pick something else?'

I said: 'No. Niche down and position differently.'

She said: 'Everyone says niche down. I'd be a life coach for working moms who want work-life balance.' I said: 'Still too broad. Go narrower.'

She went: 'Life coach for working moms in corporate jobs who want to quit and start businesses but are scared.' Bingo.

That niche had competition, but not nearly as much. And her positioning was different. She wasn't a life coach who happened to help moms. She was a former corporate mom who quit to start a business and helps others do the same.

First client: $2K. Second client: $2K. Third client: $2K.

Month three, she had 8 clients. $16K/month.

Someone commented on her post: 'How are you succeeding in such a saturated niche?' She responded: 'Life coaching is saturated. My niche isn't. There are 10 million working moms in corporate jobs. If I help 1,000 of them, I'm set for life. That's 0.01% of the market. Saturation is a myth.'

She told me: 'I used to think competition was bad. Now I realize: competition validates demand. If no one else is doing it, maybe there's no market. If everyone's doing it, there's definitely a market. I just needed to position differently.'

Here's the truth: no market is saturated. Mediocre providers saturate. Excellence differentiates. Find your unique angle. Niche down. Position clearly. You'll win regardless of competition."

---

### Objection 10: "What if I start and don't finish?"

**Story Framework:**

**Pattern:**
1. Person with history of quitting
2. Why they'd quit before
3. What was different this time
4. Accountability systems
5. Why they finished

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about Jake. He'd started (and quit) 8 different business attempts. Eight. He told me: 'I have a pattern. I get excited, start, hit a challenge, quit. Why would this be different?'

I asked: 'Why did you quit those 8?' He said: 'I was doing them alone. When I got stuck, I had no one to help. When I lost motivation, no one to push me. So I quit.'

I said: 'This program has accountability built in. Weekly group calls. Community. Progress check-ins. You won't be alone.'

He joined. Week one, he posted: 'I'm already stuck on module 2.' Three people helped. He kept going.

Week three, he lost motivation. Missed two days. I messaged him: 'You okay? Haven't seen you in the group.' He said: 'Yeah, just got discouraged.' I said: 'That's normal. Show up to tomorrow's call.' He did. Got re-motivated.

Month two, he wanted to quit. Posted in the group: 'I don't think I can do this.' Fifteen people commented: 'Yes you can. We've got you. What do you need?' He kept going.

Month four, he made his first $5K. Month six, $18K. Month nine, $35K/month.

He told me: 'This is the first thing I've ever finished. The difference? I couldn't quit because people were watching. The accountability kept me going when willpower ran out.'

Here's the reality: 30% of people who join don't finish. But 70% do. The ones who finish are the ones who engage. Show up to calls. Post in the community. Ask for help. Accountability is built into this program. Use it. You won't be alone."

---

### Objection 11: "I'm too old" / "I'm too young"

**Story Framework (Too Old):**

**Pattern:**
1. Person significantly older
2. All the age disadvantages
3. Why age was an advantage
4. Results at their age
5. Age doesn't matter message

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about Robert. He joined my program at 67 years old. Just retired from 40 years in corporate. Zero business experience.

He said: 'Am I too old for this? Everyone in your examples is in their 30s.' I said: 'You're not too old. You're experienced. That's an advantage.'

He joined. First obstacle: tech. He couldn't figure out Zoom, landing pages, email platforms. But the community helped him with every step.

Second obstacle: self-doubt. He posted: 'Why would anyone learn from a 67-year-old?' I said: 'Because you have 40 years of experience they don't. You've seen things they haven't. Age is credibility.'

He created a course: 'How to Transition to Retirement Without Losing Your Identity' - teaching corporate executives how to retire well. His target audience: people 55-70.

First launch: 23 students at $500. $11,500. He was shocked.

One student told him: 'I bought from you BECAUSE of your age. All the other retirement courses are from 35-year-olds who've never retired. You've lived it. You get it.'

Six months in, Robert had made $78K. At 67.

He told me: 'I thought my age was a liability. It was my biggest asset. My students trust me because I'm their age. I speak their language. I've lived their experience.'

Here's the truth: you're never too old. Your age is experience. Your years are credibility. There's an audience that wants to learn from someone their age, not a 25-year-old."

**Story Framework (Too Young):**

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about Emma. She joined my program at 22. Fresh out of college. Zero real-world experience.

She said: 'Who's going to buy from a 22-year-old? I'm not credible.' I said: 'You're a digital native. You understand platforms 40-year-olds don't. That's valuable.'

She created a course: 'Instagram Growth for Small Businesses.' Her target audience: small business owners 35-55 who didn't understand social media.

She positioned herself as: 'I grew up on Instagram. I'll teach you what I know intuitively that you're trying to learn.'

First launch: 31 students at $300. $9,300.

One student (age 48) told her: 'I bought from you BECAUSE you're young. My kids' generation lives on Instagram. You speak that language. I need someone who gets it natively.'

Six months in, Emma was making $25K/month. At 22.

She told me: 'I thought my age was a weakness. It was my differentiator. Older students wanted to learn from someone who actually uses the platform naturally.'

Here's the truth: you're never too young. Your age is fresh perspective. Your generation is an advantage. There's an audience that wants to learn from someone who natively understands what they're trying to learn."

---

### Objection 12: "I don't know if now is the right time"

**Story Framework:**

**Pattern:**
1. Person who waited for "right time"
2. Why it never came
3. Person who started at "wrong time"
4. Why they succeeded anyway
5. There's never a perfect time

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about two people.

Person A - Nicole: She wanted to join in January. But she said: 'I should wait until things slow down at work. Maybe in March.' March came. She said: 'Tax season just hit. Maybe after that. June.' June came. 'Kids are out of school. Too chaotic. Maybe September.' September came. 'Kids are back in school, need to adjust. Maybe next year.' Still hasn't joined. That was 2 years ago.

Person B - Amanda: She joined in December. Christmas season. Family visiting. Kids home from school. Her job was in annual review season (crazy busy). Literally the worst possible time.

I said: 'Are you sure? Maybe wait until January?' She said: 'There will always be a reason to wait. I'm starting now.'

Week one (Christmas week), she did module 1 in 30-minute chunks between family obligations.

Week two (New Year's), she did module 2.

By February, she'd launched and made $8K. By June, $30K/month.

Nicole is still waiting for the "right time."

Amanda told me: 'If I'd waited for things to calm down, I'd still be waiting. Life doesn't calm down. You make it work.'

Here's the truth: there's never a perfect time. You're always going to be busy. There's always going to be something. The question isn't 'Is now the right time?' The question is: 'Will you make time?' If the answer is yes, now is fine."

---

### Objection 13: "I need to talk to my spouse first"

**Story Framework:**

**Pattern:**
1. Person whose spouse was skeptical
2. The conversation they had
3. How they got buy-in
4. How results changed spouse's mind
5. Partnership in the journey

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about Chris. He wanted to join my program but his wife was skeptical. She said: 'You've spent $10K on courses that went nowhere. Why is this different?'

Fair question.

Chris scheduled a call with me. I said: 'Put your wife on the phone.' We all talked.

I told her: 'Here's the difference. Most courses are information. This is implementation. Chris will have accountability, support, and help when he gets stuck. But here's what I need from you: give him 30 minutes a day for 90 days. If he doesn't make progress, I'll refund you personally.'

She agreed.

Chris joined. First two weeks, nothing. Wife was skeptical. Week three, Chris made $2K. Wife: 'Okay, maybe there's something here.' Month two, $8K. Wife: 'This is working.' Month four, $20K/month. Wife: 'I'm sorry I doubted you.'

Here's what changed: results. But here's what made results possible: his wife gave him time and space to focus.

Today, Chris makes $60K/month. His wife quit her job. They built it together.

He told me: 'The conversation with my wife wasn't about convincing her the program was good. It was about showing her I was committed, asking for her support, and agreeing on what success looked like.'

Here's the truth: talk to your spouse. Don't hide it. Don't sneak it. Bring them in. Show them this is an investment. Ask for their support. Set expectations. Then deliver results. Results convert skeptical spouses faster than words ever could."

### Objection 14: "What if the economy crashes?" / "What if [external factor]?"

**Story Framework:**

**Pattern:**
1. Person who launched during crisis
2. Why they thought it was terrible timing
3. Why it actually worked
4. Adaptability > timing
5. Control what you can control

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about Sarah. She joined my program in March 2020. Yes, March 2020. COVID lockdowns started week one of her joining.

She panicked. 'I should have waited. The economy is crashing. No one's going to buy.' I said: 'Maybe. Or maybe people need solutions more than ever.'

She launched her course in April 2020: 'How to Pivot Your Business Online' (she was a retail consultant helping stores go digital).

First launch: 47 students at $500. $23,500. In the middle of a pandemic.

She was shocked. Her students told her: 'We needed this RIGHT NOW. COVID forced us online. We don't have time to figure it out ourselves.'

Six months later, she'd made $180K. During the worst economic crisis in a decade.

She told me: 'I thought COVID would kill my launch. It actually validated it. Crisis creates urgency. People need solutions faster, not slower.'

Here's the truth: there's always something. Recession fears. Elections. Pandemics. Inflation. If you wait for perfect conditions, you'll never start. The people who succeed are the ones who launch anyway and adapt to conditions. You can't control the economy. You can control your effort."

---

### Objection 15: "I'm afraid I'll fail" / "What if I look stupid?"

**Story Framework:**

**Pattern:**
1. Person paralyzed by fear
2. Specific fears (be vulnerable)
3. What happened when they tried anyway
4. Failure happened (and it was fine)
5. Courage over confidence

**Example Story:**

"Let me tell you about Daniel. He joined my program but didn't launch for 3 months. He'd done all the modules. Created his offer. Built his landing page. But he didn't launch.

I messaged him: 'What's going on?' He said: 'I'm terrified. What if no one buys? What if people think I'm a fraud? What if I fail publicly?'

I said: 'You will fail. Something will go wrong. A tech issue. A refund. A harsh comment. Failure is guaranteed. The question is: are you going to fail while trying or fail by not trying?'

He thought about it. He launched.

Week one: 3 sales. He was thrilled. Week two: 1 refund. He was devastated. Posted in the group: 'Someone refunded. They said the course wasn't what they expected. I'm a failure.'

I said: 'You're not a failure. You have a 75% satisfaction rate. 3 happy customers, 1 unhappy. That's normal. Refine the course. Keep going.'

He did. Second launch: 12 sales, 1 refund. 92% satisfaction.

Six months in: $40K in revenue, 5% refund rate, dozens of happy students.

He told me: 'I was waiting to feel confident before I launched. But confidence doesn't come before action. It comes after. I had to launch afraid. Failure happened. And I survived. That's when I became confident.'

Here's the truth: you will fail at something. A tech glitch. A typo on your sales page. Someone will criticize you. Someone will refund. That's not a reason to not start. That's the cost of entry. Failure is data. Courage is launching anyway. You won't feel ready. Do it anyway."

## How to Deploy Objection Stories

### Strategic Placement

**Sales Page:**
- FAQ section: Embed story in each answer
- Before/after pricing: Address price objections
- Throughout copy: Use mini-stories

**Webinar:**
- Q&A section: Have stories ready for each common objection
- Transition to offer: Pre-handle top 3 objections with stories

**Email Sequence:**
- Email 3: "I don't have time" story
- Email 4: "Too expensive" story
- Email 5: "Tried before" story
- Email 6: "I'm different" story

**Sales Calls:**
- Listen for objection
- Say: "Let me tell you about [person]..."
- Tell relevant story
- Don't argue, just share

### The Objection Library

**Build a database:**

For each objection:
- 3-5 different stories
- Different demographics
- Different contexts
- Keep updated

**Example organization:**

```
OBJECTION: "I don't have time"
