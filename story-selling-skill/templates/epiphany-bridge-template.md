## Completed Example: Business Coaching

### Part 1: The Backstory

**Three years ago, I was a freelance graphic designer making $4,200/month.**

**I was struggling with being stuck at that income despite working 55 hours a week.**

**I had tried taking on more clients, raising my prices slightly, and working faster.**

**None of it worked because I was still trading hours for dollars - there's only so many hours in a week.**

**I felt trapped and exhausted.**

---

### Part 2: Your Desire

**I didn't want to be rich - I wanted freedom.**

**I wanted to wake up without dreading my inbox or feeling behind before I started.**

**I imagined working 20-25 hours a week, making the same or more money, and actually having time to read a book or go hiking on a Wednesday.**

**If I could just break free from hourly billing, then I could build a life instead of just a business.**

---

### Part 3: The Wall

**But I was blocked by my pricing model.**

**Every time I tried to make more money, I'd have to work more hours.**

**I thought the problem was my rates, so I raised them from $75/hour to $100/hour.**

**That didn't work because I lost two clients and ended up making LESS despite higher rates.**

**I was stuck in a pattern: want more money → work more hours → burn out → repeat.**

---

### Part 4: The Epiphany

**Then on a Tuesday afternoon at 2pm, I was on a call with a client when she mentioned that one blog post I wrote for her drove $50,000 in sales.**

**I noticed I'd charged her $500 for that post.**

**That's when I realized: I was charging for my TIME when I should be charging for the VALUE I create.**

**Everything suddenly made sense.**

**The problem wasn't my hourly rate - it was that I was billing hourly at all.**

---

### Part 5: The Plan

**I decided to test it.**

**I sent emails to my 3 best clients offering a new pricing model: $2,500 per blog post (not per hour), with a guarantee it would drive at least $10,000 in measurable results.**

**Two of them said yes immediately. One said she'd think about it.**

**I was shocked - I'd just tripled my rate and they said YES.**

**I refined it by creating a clear deliverable (one blog post, three revisions, performance tracking) instead of just "hours of work."**

**I tested it again with two new prospects. Both signed at $2,500.**

---

### Part 6: The Conflict

**Of course, it wasn't perfect at first.**

**I faced a client who wanted unlimited revisions because "that's what my old writer offered."**

**I almost caved and gave in because I was scared to lose the client.**

**But I held firm. I said: "My model is different. You're paying for results, not revisions. Let's focus on getting this right in three rounds."**

**I learned that clear boundaries actually make clients respect you MORE, not less.**

**I kept going because for the first time in years, I felt like I had control of my business.**

---

### Part 7: The Achievement

**Today, I make $28,000/month as a content strategist.**

**I work 25 hours a week. I have 8 clients paying $3,000-$5,000/month each. I took a month-long trip to Portugal last summer.**

**But more importantly, I'm present. I don't work weekends. I don't stress about money.**

**I can say no to projects that don't excite me.**

**When I think back to where I was 3 years ago, I'm amazed at how one insight changed everything.**

---

### Part 8: The Transformation

**I'm sharing this because I wasted 5 years billing hourly when I should have been billing for value.**

**I believe any freelancer, consultant, or service provider can make this shift - you don't need a huge portfolio or fancy credentials.**

**If you're maxed out on hours but stuck on income, I want to show you how to transition to value-based pricing in 90 days.**

**I created a program that gives you the exact pricing models, proposal templates, and client scripts I use.**

**You don't need 5 years of trial and error. You need the proven system.**
