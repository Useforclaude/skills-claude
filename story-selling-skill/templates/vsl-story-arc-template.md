# VSL Story Arc Template: Video Sales Letter Narrative Structure

## WHAT IS A VSL?

A Video Sales Letter (VSL) is a long-form video (typically 15-30 minutes) that tells a story leading to an offer. Unlike webinars, VSLs are:
- Pre-recorded (not live)
- Watched individually (not group event)
- Optimized for rewatching
- Often text-on-screen + voiceover

## ACT 1: THE HOOK (Minutes 0:00-2:00)

**Purpose:** Stop the scroll, grab attention

**Template:**

**[On screen]:** [Shocking statement or number]

**[Voiceover]:**
"[Timeframe] ago, I [Impressive/Shocking Result].

Most people think you need [Common Belief]. That's wrong.

I'm going to show you exactly how I did it - and how you can too - even if [Common Objection].

But first, let me tell you a story."

**Example:**

"Three years ago, I made $127,000 in 30 days. From my laptop. While traveling in Bali.

Most people think you need a huge audience or years of experience. That's wrong.

I'm going to show you exactly how I did it - and how you can too - even if you're starting from zero.

But first, let me tell you a story."

---

### Frame 2: The Promise (0:15-0:45)

**[On screen]:** "Here's What You'll Discover:"

**[Voiceover]:**

- [Promise 1 - Specific outcome]
- [Promise 2 - Specific outcome]
- [Promise 3 - Specific outcome]

By the end, you'll know exactly [What They'll Understand].

And I'll show you proof that this works - not just for me, but for [Type of People] just like you.

Ready? Let's dive in."

---

### Frame 3: Credibility (0:45-2:00)

**[On screen]:** "Who Am I?"

**[Voiceover - 60-Second Origin Snippet]:**

"Quick intro: My name is [Name].

[Timeframe] ago, I was [Relatable Struggle].

Then I discovered [The Thing].

I went from [Before State] to [After State] in [Timeframe].

Since then, I've helped [Number] people do the same.

People like [Quick Name-Drop of One Student + Result].

So that's who I am. Now let me tell you the story of how this all started."

---

## ACT 2: THE JOURNEY (Minutes 2:00-10:00)

### Frame 4: The Backstory (2:00-4:00)

**[On screen]:** "Where It All Began..."

**[Voiceover - Your Full Origin Story]:**

"[Specific date/period], I was [Detailed Before State].

I was struggling with [Specific Problem - same one your viewer has].

I'd tried [Failed Attempt 1]. That didn't work because [Why].

I tried [Failed Attempt 2]. That failed because [Why].

I tried [Failed Attempt 3]. Same result.

I was frustrated. I was [Emotional State].

I remember thinking: '[Thought/Quote That Captures Desperation].'

I was about to [Give Up / Quit / Try Something Else].

But then something happened that changed everything."

---

### Frame 5: The Turning Point (4:00-6:00)

**[On screen]:** "The Moment Everything Changed..."

**[Voiceover - The Epiphany Story]:**

"[Specific Day/Time], I was [What You Were Doing] when [Trigger Event].

I noticed [Observation - What Others Miss].

I thought: '[Verbalize the Epiphany].'

It sounds simple now, but at the time, it was a revelation.

I realized: [The Insight].

I decided to test it."

---

### Frame 6: The Test (6:00-8:00)

**[On screen]:** "The Test..."

**[Voiceover]:**

"Here's what I did.

I [Specific Action 1].
I [Specific Action 2].
I [Specific Action 3].

I wasn't sure if it would work. But I committed.

[Timeframe] later: [First Result - Specific Number].

I couldn't believe it. I thought maybe it was a fluke.

So I tested it again. [Second Result - Better Number].

That's when I knew: this wasn't luck. This was a system.

I refined it. I [How You Improved It].

And the results kept getting better."

---

### Frame 7: The Transformation (8:00-10:00)

**[On screen]:** "The Results..."

**[Voiceover]:**

"Over the next [Timeframe], I went from [Before Metric] to [After Metric].

But here's what really changed:

[Life Impact 1 - Beyond Numbers].
[Life Impact 2].
[Life Impact 3].

I went from [Identity Before] to [Identity After].

And I thought: if this worked for me, what if I could help others do the same?

So I started teaching it."

## ACT 3: THE SOLUTION (Minutes 10:00-18:00)

### Frame 8: Proof (It Works for Others) (10:00-14:00)

**[On screen]:** "Does This Work for Others?"

**[Case Study 1]:**

Meet [Name]. They were [Situation - Relatable to Viewer].

They implemented this system. [Timeline] later: [Result].

They told me: '[Quote].'

**[Case Study 2]:**

Or [Name]. They were [Different Situation - Cover Different Objection].

Same system. [Timeline] later: [Result].

They said: '[Quote].'

**[Case Study 3]:**

Or [Name]...

[Continue pattern - 3-5 quick case studies, each 45-60 seconds]

So it's not just me. This works for [Type of People]."

### Frame 9: The Method (14:00-16:00)

**[On screen]:** "How Does This Actually Work?"

**[Voiceover]:**

"You're probably wondering: okay, but HOW does this work?

Great question. Let me break it down.

There are 3 core principles:

**Principle 1: [Name]**
[Explain in simple terms - 30 seconds]

**Principle 2: [Name]**
[Explain in simple terms - 30 seconds]

**Principle 3: [Name]**
[Explain in simple terms - 30 seconds]

These three principles work together to [How They Create the Result].

Now, you could try to figure this out yourself. Piece it together from blog posts and YouTube videos.

But here's the problem..."

---

### Frame 10: The Problem with DIY (16:00-17:00)

**[On screen]:** "Why 'Figuring It Out Yourself' Doesn't Work"

**[Voiceover]:**

"I spent [Timeframe] and $[Amount] figuring this out.

I made [Number] costly mistakes.

I wasted [Timeframe] going down dead ends.

You could do the same. Or...

That's why I created [Product Name]."

### Frame 11: Introducing the Solution (17:00-18:00)

**[On screen]:** "[Product Name]"

**[Voiceover]:**

"[Product Name] is a [Format - Course/Program/System] that gives you everything you need to [Desired Outcome] in [Timeframe].

Let me show you what's inside."

This is [What It Is].

I created this because [Quick Story - 15 seconds].

[Student Name] used just this one component to [Result].

**[On screen]:** 

~~$X,XXX~~

**Your Investment: $XXX**

**[Voiceover]:**

"Your investment today is just $[Price].

Now, I know what you might be thinking: '[Common Price Objection].'

Let me tell you a quick story.

[Price Justification Story - 45 seconds]:

[Student Name] was [Tough Financial Situation]. They told me they couldn't afford $[Price].

I asked: 'How much is staying stuck costing you?'

They calculated: [Amount They Were Losing by Not Changing].

They joined. [Timeline] later, they'd made $[ROI Amount] - [X]x their investment.

They told me: '[Quote about Best Money They Ever Spent].'

So the question isn't: can you afford $[Price]?

The question is: can you afford NOT to invest in yourself?"

**[On screen]:** "[X]-Day Money-Back Guarantee"

[Bonus Name]
Value: $XXX

**Only Available for Next [X] Hours**"

**[Voiceover]:**

"One more thing.

If you join right now - in the next [X] hours - you also get [Bonus Name].

This is [What It Is - Quick Description].

[Student Name] used it to [Result].

Normally $[Amount]. Yours free if you join before [Specific Deadline].

---

### Frame 18: Final Reminder (25:00-25:30)
