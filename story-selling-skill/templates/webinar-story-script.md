Before we dive in, quick tech check: Can you see my screen? If yes, type 'YES' in the chat. 

[Pause for responses]

Perfect. Okay, here's what we're going to cover in the next [60/90] minutes:

I'm going to show you [Promise 1], [Promise 2], and [Promise 3].

By the end, you'll know exactly [Transformation they'll understand by the end].

But more importantly, you'll see that [Result they want] is 100% possible for you - even if [Common Objection].

Sound good? Alright, let's dive in."

### Slide 3: Who Am I? (Your 3-Minute Origin Story)

**Script:**

"Quick intro so you know who I am and why you should listen to me.

[Timeframe] ago, I was [Relatable Struggle - mirror your audience].

I was struggling with [Specific Problem].

I'd tried [Failed Attempt 1], [Failed Attempt 2], and [Failed Attempt 3]. Nothing worked.

Then I discovered [The Thing That Changed Everything].

I tested it. [Quick Result].

I refined it. [Better Result].

Today, [Current State - achievement].

More importantly, I've helped [Number] people achieve [Transformation].

People like [Quick Mini-Story of One Student].

So that's my story. But this webinar isn't about me - it's about YOU and what's possible for you.

Let's talk about who this is FOR."

### Slide 4: Who This Is For

**Script:**

"This webinar is for you if:

- You're currently [Situation 1] and want to [Desired Outcome 1]
- You've tried [Common Failed Approach] but it didn't work

This is NOT for you if:

- You're looking for [False Promise - get rich quick, magic pill, etc.]
- You're not willing to [Effort Required]

Make sense?

If you're in the right room, type 'I'M IN' in the chat.

[Pause for responses]

Awesome. Let's go."

### Slide 5: The Big Promise

**Script:**

"Here's what I'm going to show you today:

I'm going to share 3 secrets:

**Secret #1:** [Insight 1 - Teaser]
**Secret #2:** [Insight 2 - Teaser]
**Secret #3:** [Insight 3 - Teaser]

Each of these secrets comes from a discovery story. And I'm going to share those stories with you, along with the lessons I learned.

Let's start with Secret #1."

---

### SECRET #1 (Minutes 10-20)

"[Secret #1 Title - e.g., 'It's Not About Time, It's About Energy']"

[Full Story - Use Epiphany Bridge Framework]:

- **Backstory:** [Where I was, what I was struggling with]

Here's what this means for you: [Application to their situation]."

**Slide 11: Case Study**

[Quick Case Study - 2-3 minutes]:

- Before: [Specific state]
- Discovered Secret #1

[Student Name] told me: '[Quote].'

So that's Secret #1: [Restate the core lesson].

Make sense? Type 'YES' if you're following along.

Let's move to Secret #2."

These three secrets can absolutely transform your [area of focus].

But here's the problem..."

---

### SLIDE 24: THE PROBLEM (The Transition)

**Script:**

"You now KNOW these three secrets. But knowing and DOING are two different things.

Here's what usually happens:

You watch this webinar. You get inspired. You think: 'I'm going to do this!'

Then you close this page. You go back to work. Life happens. And 3 months from now, nothing has changed.

I don't want that for you.

So I've created something to make sure you actually IMPLEMENT these secrets.

Let me show you what I've built."

---

## ACT 3: THE OFFER (Minutes 40-70)

### SLIDE 25: Introducing [Program Name]

**Script:**

"I created a program called [Program Name].

It's designed to help you [Desired Outcome] in [Timeframe].

Here's what you get inside..."

---

### SLIDES 26-35: THE STACK (Tell a Story for Each Component)

**For EACH component, use this pattern:**

**Slide:** "[Component Name]"

**Script:**

"The first thing you get is [Component 1 - Name].

Let me tell you why this matters.

[Mini-Story - 1-2 minutes]:

Last [timeframe], I had a student named [Name]. They [Problem]. I gave them [This Component]. They [Implemented It]. Results: [Specific Outcome].

They told me: '[Quote].'

That's the power of [Component 1].

Value: $[Amount] if purchased separately."

[Repeat for each component - 8-12 total]

---

### SLIDE 36: TOTAL VALUE STACK

**On Screen:**

- Component 1: $X
- Component 2: $X
- Component 3: $X
- ...
- **Total Value: $XX,XXX**

**Script:**

"So if you added up everything individually, the total value is $[Total].

But you're not going to pay $[Total] today.

I'm going to do something different."

---

### SLIDE 37: THE PRICE

**On Screen:**

~~$XX,XXX~~ â†’ **$X,XXX**

**Script:**

"Your investment today is just $[Price].

Now, before you think about whether you can afford it, let me tell you a story.

[Price Justification Story - 2-3 minutes]:

I had a student named [Name]. They were in [Tough Financial Situation]. They told me: 'I can't afford $[Price].'

I asked them: 'Can you afford to stay where you are?'

They thought about it. They said: 'No. Staying stuck is costing me more than $[Price].'

They joined. [Timeline] later, they'd made $[Amount] - [X]x their investment back.

They told me: '[Quote about ROI].'

So the question isn't can you afford $[Price]. The question is: can you afford NOT to invest in yourself?"

---

### SLIDE 38: GUARANTEE

**On Screen:**

"[X]-Day Money-Back Guarantee"

**Script:**

"And to make this a no-brainer, here's my guarantee:

[Guarantee Details].

[Guarantee Story - 1-2 minutes]:

Let me tell you about [Student]. They joined, skeptical. They went through the first [X] modules. They implemented. They [Didn't Get Results Initially / Had Doubts].

But they kept going because [They Trusted the Process / Saw Small Wins].

[Timeline] later: [Big Results].

Point is: I stand behind this program. If you do the work and don't get results, [Guarantee Terms].

Fair?"

---

### SLIDES 39-45: OBJECTION HANDLING (Through Stories)

**For each major objection, dedicate a slide:**

**Slide 39: "What if I don't have time?"**

**Script:**

"Maybe you're thinking: 'This sounds great, but I don't have time.'

Let me tell you about [Name]...

[Full Objection Story - 2-3 minutes]

So if you're worried about time, don't be. [Timeframe] commitment is all you need."

[Repeat for 4-6 major objections]

---

### SLIDE 46: BONUS - URGENCY

**On Screen:**

"BONUS: [Bonus Name] (Value: $XXX)

**But only if you join in the next [X] hours**"

**Script:**

"One more thing.

If you join before [Deadline - specific time], you also get [Bonus Name].

[Bonus Story - 1 minute]:

This is [What It Is]. I created it because [Why]. [Student Name] used it to [Result].

Value: $[Amount].

But it's only available if you join before [Deadline].

After that, it's gone."

I'll wait while you do that.

[Pause - 30 seconds]"

---

## ACT 4: Q&A (Minutes 70-90)

### SLIDE 48: Q&A

**Script:**

"While people are joining, let's do some Q&A.

Drop your questions in the chat. I'll answer as many as I can.

And remember - every question you don't ask keeps you stuck where you are.

So ask. Let's do this."

**[Answer 5-10 questions - each answer should be a STORY whenever possible]**

**For example:**

**Q: "Will this work for [specific niche]?"**

**A:** "Great question. Let me tell you about [Person in That Niche]. They asked the same thing. Here's what happened... [Story]. So yes, it works for [Niche]."
