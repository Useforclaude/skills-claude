# Ethical Storytelling Guidelines

## Core Principle

**Emotional truth ≠ License to lie**

Stories should be emotionally authentic AND factually honest.

## The Rules

### 1. Never Fabricate Core Facts

**Don't:**
- Invent results you didn't achieve
- Create fake testimonials
- Fabricate customer stories
- Lie about timelines
- Exaggerate numbers

**Do:**
- Tell real stories
- Use actual results
- Get permission for testimonials
- Be accurate with timeframes
- Report honest numbers

### 2. Transparency About Composites

**If combining multiple stories:**
"This story represents a composite of several clients' experiences."

**If dramatizing real events:**
"Details have been adjusted for clarity, but the core truth remains."

### 3. Don't Cherry-Pick

**Don't:**
Share only your best results while hiding typical outcomes

**Do:**
Present realistic expectations, share range of results

### 4. Respect Privacy

**Always:**
- Get permission to share customer stories
- Offer anonymity options
- Respect confidential information
- Don't share without consent

### 5. Avoid Manipulation

**Don't:**
- Use fear tactics dishonestly
- Create false urgency
- Exploit insecurities
- Manipulate emotions for sales

**Do:**
- Present real urgency
- Address genuine concerns
- Inspire through authentic stories
- Build trust through truth

### 6. Acknowledge Privilege/Advantage

**If applicable:**
- "I had advantages not everyone has..."
- "This won't work for everyone because..."
- "Your situation may differ..."

**Don't:**
Make your path seem easily replicable when it required unique circumstances

### 7. Disclose Material Connections

**Always disclose:**
- Affiliate relationships
- Sponsored content
- Paid endorsements
- Material benefits

### 8. Emotional Truth vs. Factual Truth

**Emotional Truth (Acceptable):**
Compressing timeline for narrative flow
Combining similar events
Omitting boring parts
Focusing on meaningful moments

**Factual Truth (Non-Negotiable):**
Results achieved
Money earned/lost
Timelines (approximately)
Promises made
Outcomes delivered

### 9. The "Would I Be Okay If They Found Out?" Test

Before publishing any story, ask:

"If my customer/audience discovered the full truth, would they feel:
- Deceived?
- Manipulated?
- Misled?
- Respected?
- Accurately represented?"

If the first three: revise your story.

### 10. Vulnerability ≠ Trauma Dumping

**Don't:**
- Overshare for shock value
- Use trauma as manipulation
- Exploit others' pain
- Share what's not yours to share

**Do:**
- Share purposefully
- Serve the story's lesson
- Maintain dignity
- Respect boundaries

## Red Flags

Your story may cross ethical lines if:

- [ ] You wouldn't want your customer to read it
- [ ] You've exaggerated numbers "just a little"
- [ ] You're hiding key context
- [ ] You feel uncomfortable about it
- [ ] You wouldn't share it with your mother
- [ ] You're creating false urgency
- [ ] You're exploiting fear
- [ ] You're being misleading

## The Long-Term View

**Short-term:** Exaggeration might increase conversions

**Long-term:** Discovered dishonesty destroys trust forever

**Choose:** Build a business on authentic stories or build a house of cards

## When in Doubt

Ask yourself:

1. **Is this true?**
2. **Is this fair?**
3. **Will this build trust?**
4. **Would I want this done to me?**
5. **Can I stand behind this in 5 years?**

If you can't answer "yes" to all five: don't publish it.

## Remember

**Great storytelling doesn't require dishonesty.**

The truth—when told compellingly—is more powerful than any fabrication.

Your real stories are interesting enough. Trust them.
