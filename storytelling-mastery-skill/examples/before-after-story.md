# Before vs. After: Weak vs. Strong Storytelling

## Example 1: SaaS Product

### WEAK VERSION:
"Our CRM helps sales teams close more deals. It has automation features and detailed analytics."

**Problems:**
- No story
- Generic benefits
- No emotional connection
- Could describe any CRM

### STRONG VERSION:
"Marcus was drowning in spreadsheets. Every morning: update pipeline, send follow-ups, log activities. By 2 PM, he hadn't made a single new call.

Then he tried our CRM. Day 1: automated his entire morning routine. Month 1: freed up 12 hours per week. Month 3: closed 40% more deals with the same effort.

Today, Marcus starts his day making callsâ€”not doing data entry. The deals close themselves while he's focused on the next one."

**Why It Works:**
- Specific character (Marcus)
- Clear "before" pain
- Transformation shown
- Concrete results
