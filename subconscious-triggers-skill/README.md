## Ethical Checklist

Before using any trigger:

- [ ] Does this benefit users or just metrics?
- [ ] Would users approve if they knew?
- [ ] Can users easily opt-out?
- [ ] Are all statements factually true?
- [ ] Could this harm vulnerable populations?
- [ ] Would I use this on my family?

**If all YES → Ethical**
**If any NO → Reconsider**
