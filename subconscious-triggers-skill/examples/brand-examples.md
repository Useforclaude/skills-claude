## Lessons for Designers

**1. Multiple Triggers Compound**
- Don't rely on one technique
- Stack 3-5 triggers for maximum effect
- Ensure all point in same direction

**2. Authenticity Matters**
- Fake scarcity gets discovered
- Genuine value builds trust
- Long-term reputation > short-term gains

**3. Sensory Integration Wins**
- Visual + auditory + tactile = strongest memory
- Cross-modal consistency = recognition
- Distinctive = trademark-able

**4. Identity > Features**
- People buy who they want to become
- Nike doesn't sell shoes, sells athletic identity
- Apple doesn't sell computers, sells creative identity

**5. Friction at Right Points**
- Remove friction from desired actions (purchase)
- Add friction to undesired actions (cancellation)
- BUT: Don't cross into dark patterns
