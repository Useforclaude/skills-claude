# Priming Effects: Comprehensive Research Guide

## Overview

Priming is the implicit memory effect where exposure to a stimulus influences response to a later stimulus. This document catalogs 15+ types with research evidence.

---

## 1. Semantic Priming

**Definition:** Word meaning facilitates processing of related words

**Classic Study: Meyer & Schvaneveldt (1971)**
- Task: Lexical decision (word vs non-word)
- Prime: "DOCTOR"
- Target: "NURSE" (related) vs "BREAD" (unrelated)
- Result: 85ms faster for related words
- Mechanism: Spreading activation in semantic network

**Applications:**
- Content marketing: Prime "problem" → solution more appealing
- Product descriptions: Prime quality attributes → higher perceived value
- Email subject lines: Prime curiosity → higher open rates

**Effect Size:** d = 0.42 (medium)

---

## 2. Perceptual Priming

**Definition:** Previous exposure facilitates later perception

**Study: Jacoby & Dallas (1981)**
- Phase 1: Flash words for 35ms
- Phase 2: Identify same words presented briefly
- Result: 23% better identification for primed words
- Duration: Lasts days to weeks

**Applications:**
- Brand logo repetition (subliminal exposure)
- Packaging design consistency
- UI pattern familiarity

**Effect Size:** d = 0.31 (small-medium)

---

## 3. Affective Priming

**Definition:** Emotional valence of prime affects judgment

**Study: Fazio et al. (1986)**
- Prime: Positive/negative images (300ms)
- Task: Categorize words as good/bad
- Result: 56ms faster for congruent pairs
- Example: Puppy (positive) → "wonderful" (faster)

**Applications:**
- Show happy faces before pricing
- Positive imagery in checkout flow
- Music selection in retail

**Effect Size:** d = 0.38 (medium)

---

## 4. Behavioral Priming

**Definition:** Exposed concepts influence subsequent behavior

**Famous Study: Bargh et al. (1996) - "Elderly Priming"**
- Participants unscrambled sentences with elderly-related words
- Measured: Walking speed afterward
- Result: Walked 13% slower than control group
- Controversy: Failed to replicate in some studies

**Note:** Behavioral priming is most controversial type (replication crisis)

**More Robust Example: Williams & Bargh (2008) - "Hot Coffee Study"**
- Held hot vs iced coffee
- Rated person's personality
- Result: Hot coffee → 41% more "warm" personality ratings
- Replication: Successful in multiple studies

**Applications (use cautiously):**
- Prime "success" imagery before user goals
- Warm colors for friendly interactions
- Power poses before presentations (weak evidence)

**Effect Size:** d = 0.15-0.35 (small to medium, high variability)

---

## 5. Conceptual Priming

**Definition:** Abstract concept activation influences thoughts

**Study: Kay et al. (2004) - "Business Priming"**
- Exposed to business objects (briefcase, pen) vs control
- Task: Ultimatum game (money sharing)
- Result: Business-primed participants 67% more selfish
- Mechanism: Activated competition schema

**Applications:**
- Luxury imagery → higher price acceptance
- Collaboration cues → more sharing behavior
- Achievement imagery → higher effort

**Effect Size:** d = 0.29 (small-medium)

---

## 6. Goal Priming

**Definition:** Exposure to goal-related cues activates goal pursuit

**Study: Chartrand & Bargh (1996)**
- Subliminal prime: Achievement-related words
- Task: Word puzzles
- Result: 34% more puzzles solved
- Duration: Effect lasted 15+ minutes

**Applications:**
- Fitness app: Prime "strength" "endurance" "progress"
- Learning platform: Prime "mastery" "expert" "knowledge"
- Productivity tool: Prime "focus" "accomplish" "complete"

**Effect Size:** d = 0.43 (medium)

---

## 7. Stereotype Priming

**Definition:** Activation of stereotypes influences behavior

**Study: Shih et al. (1999) - "Asian Women Math"**
- Asian-American women took math test
- Condition A: Primed with Asian identity → +11% score
- Condition B: Primed with female identity → -6% score
- Mechanism: Stereotype activation (Asians good at math, women worse)

**Applications (ETHICAL ONLY):**
- ✅ Prime positive identities ("smart users like you")
- ❌ NEVER exploit negative stereotypes

**Effect Size:** d = 0.31 (medium)

---

## 8. Supraliminal vs Subliminal Priming

**Subliminal (<50ms, below awareness):**
- **Research:** Kunst-Wilson & Zajonc (1980)
- Shapes flashed for 5ms
- Result: Couldn't recognize, but preferred primed shapes
- Effect: Small (d = 0.2)
- Duration: Minutes only

**Supraliminal (>50ms, above awareness but not focus):**
- **Research:** Strahan et al. (2002)
- Thirst-related words (visible but incidental)
- Result: 14% more water consumed IF already thirsty
- Effect: Medium (d = 0.35)
- Duration: Up to 30 minutes

**Key Insight:** Supraliminal priming is stronger and more ethical

---

## 9. Repetition Priming

**Definition:** Repeated exposure facilitates processing

**Study: Scarborough et al. (1977)**
- Word presented multiple times
- Recognition speed increased with each exposure
- Plateau: After 3-5 exposures (diminishing returns)

**Applications:**
- Brand exposure: 3-7 times optimal
- Key messages: Repeat in different formats
- Visual consistency: Use same design language

**Effect Size:** d = 0.52 (medium-large)

---

## 10. Associative Priming

**Definition:** Associated concepts facilitate each other

**Study: Neely (1977)**
- Prime: "BIRD"
- Target: "ROBIN" (associated) vs "TRUCK" (unassociated)
- Result: 112ms faster for associated
- SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony): 250ms optimal

**Applications:**
- Product pairings: Coffee → Morning → Energy
- Brand associations: Apple → Innovation → Premium
- Content clustering: Related articles together

**Effect Size:** d = 0.48 (medium)

---

## 11. Response Priming

**Definition:** Motor response preparation

**Study: Eimer & Schlaghecken (1998)**
- Arrow primes (left/right)
- Response: Press corresponding button
- Result: 34ms faster for congruent directions
- Note: Reversed at very short SOAs (<100ms)

**Applications:**
- Button placement matching expectations (Submit on right)
- Directional cues (arrows, gaze) toward desired action
- Physical affordances in UI design

**Effect Size:** d = 0.41 (medium)

---

## 12. Cross-Modal Priming

**Definition:** One sensory modality primes another

**Study: Spence (2011) - "Crossmodal Correspondences"**
- Sound pitch affects taste perception
- High-pitch → sweet, Low-pitch → bitter
- Result: 27% difference in sweetness ratings

**Applications:**
- Music selection affects product perception
- Package texture influences taste expectations
- Visual weight affects perceived physical weight

**Effect Size:** d = 0.33 (medium)

---

## 13. Masked Priming

**Definition:** Prime is "masked" by subsequent stimulus

**Study: Marcel (1983)**
- Prime word (30ms) → Mask (###) → Target word
- Prime not consciously perceived
- Result: Still shows semantic priming effect
- Effect: Smaller than unmasked (d = 0.18 vs 0.42)

**Applications (Limited):**
- Rapid image sequences in video
- Subliminal brand placement (ethically questionable)

**Effect Size:** d = 0.18 (small)

---

## 14. Negative Priming

**Definition:** Ignored stimuli become harder to process later

**Study: Tipper (1985)**
- Task: Name red object, ignore green
- Later: Name previously-ignored object
- Result: 43ms slower (inhibition carryover)

**Applications:**
- Don't repeatedly show then hide features (frustrating)
- Avoid flip-flopping UI elements
- Clear visual hierarchy (don't force ignoring important items)

**Effect Size:** d = 0.36 (medium)

---

## 15. Evaluative Conditioning (Long-term Priming)

**Definition:** Repeated pairing creates lasting associations

**Study: De Houwer et al. (2001) - Meta-analysis**
- Pair neutral stimulus with positive/negative
- Measure attitude change
- Result: Mean effect size d = 0.52
- Duration: Days to weeks (longer than typical priming)

**Applications:**
- Brand + Positive imagery (ads)
- Logo + Successful experiences (product design)
- Color + Emotion (consistent use)

**Effect Size:** d = 0.52 (medium-large)

## Priming Duration Timeline

| Priming Type | Duration | Decay Pattern |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| Perceptual | Days-weeks | Slow decay |
| Semantic | 1-5 minutes | Exponential |
| Affective | 5-30 minutes | Linear |
| Behavioral | 10-60 minutes | Variable |
| Conceptual | 15-90 minutes | Gradual |
| Goal | 15+ minutes | Maintains until goal met |
| Evaluative | Days-weeks | Very slow |

## Moderating Factors

**1. Awareness:**
- Unconscious priming: Smaller but more persistent
- Conscious priming: Larger but shorter-lived

**2. Individual Differences:**
- Need for cognition: High = less susceptible
- Working memory: Higher = more controlled processing
- Age: Elderly show larger priming effects (+23%)

**3. Context:**
- Relevant to current goal: +67% effect size
- Mood congruence: +34% effect
- Fatigue/cognitive load: +45% susceptibility

**4. Strength of Prime:**
- Multiple exposures: Saturates at 3-5 repetitions
- Duration: 300ms optimal for most types
- Salience: More distinctive = stronger (up to +40%)

---

## Ethical Considerations

**Acceptable Priming:**
- ✅ Aligns with user goals (prime "learning" in educational app)
- ✅ Enhances user experience (warm colors → friendly)
- ✅ Above awareness threshold (visible but incidental)
- ✅ Can be disclosed if asked

**Unacceptable Priming:**
- ❌ Creates desires user didn't have (prime "luxury" to sell premium)
- ❌ Below awareness threshold (subliminal)
- ❌ Exploits vulnerabilities (prime "lonely" to sell dating)
- ❌ Contradicts stated user intent
