# Subliminal Persuasion Implementation Checklist

## Pre-Implementation Audit

### Ethical Review
Before using ANY subliminal technique, complete this ethical audit:

#### Product/Service Quality
- [ ] Product actually delivers on promised benefits
- [ ] No harmful side effects or hidden risks
- [ ] Claims can be substantiated with evidence

- [ ] Audience can make informed, voluntary choice

**If ANY vulnerable population targeted → Extra ethical review required**

#### Transparency and Reversibility
- [ ] Can explain techniques if asked

## Subliminal Technique Selection Checklist

### Visual Subliminals

#### Eye Gaze Direction
- [ ] Human images direct eyes toward CTA or key message
- [ ] NOT staring at camera (which engages but doesn't direct)
- [ ] Natural, not forced or obvious
- [ ] Tested with eye-tracking or heat mapping (if possible)

**Expected effect:** 20-40% increase in attention to target element

#### Color Psychology
- [ ] Primary color matches brand positioning:
  - Trust/Professional → Blue
  - Urgency/Energy → Red/Orange
  - Premium/Luxury → Black/Gold
  - Natural/Organic → Green
  - Creative/Fun → Purple/Bright colors

- [ ] CTA button is highest contrast element on page
- [ ] Color meanings researched for target culture
- [ ] Accessibility considered (color-blind users)

**Expected effect:** 10-20% increase in CTA clicks with optimal color

#### Visual Hierarchy
- [ ] Most important element largest/highest contrast
- [ ] Clear F-pattern or Z-pattern flow
- [ ] White space used strategically for premium positioning
- [ ] 3 levels maximum (primary, secondary, tertiary)

**Expected effect:** 30-50% improvement in message comprehension

#### Directional Cues
- [ ] Subtle arrows or design elements point to CTA
- [ ] NOT obvious/pushy (no "CLICK HERE →" in large text)
- [ ] One main directional cue per section
- [ ] Tested to ensure guides eye naturally

**Expected effect:** 10-15% increase in CTA engagement

#### Gestalt Principles
- [ ] Related items grouped by proximity
- [ ] Similar items styled consistently
- [ ] Incomplete patterns used sparingly (closure effect)
- [ ] Symmetry for trust, asymmetry for attention

**Expected effect:** 15-25% improvement in page scan-ability

---

### Cognitive Subliminals

#### Anchoring
- [ ] High anchor shown before actual price/value
- [ ] Anchor is TRUE (not fabricated)
- [ ] Comparison is fair (apples-to-apples)
- [ ] Multiple anchors used (price, time, features)

**Example anchors:**
- [ ] Competitor price (real competitor)
- [ ] Original price (genuine, not inflated)
- [ ] Time saved (measured or estimated conservatively)
- [ ] Cost of problem (quantified)

**Expected effect:** 15-30% increase in perceived value

#### Framing
- [ ] Chosen frame (gain vs loss) matches decision context:
  - Prevention/Health → Loss frame
  - Treatment/Improvement → Gain frame
  - Urgency → Loss frame
  - Aspiration → Gain frame

- [ ] Same information not contradictory in different frames
- [ ] Material information not hidden through framing
- [ ] Both sides presented for major decisions

**Expected effect:** 20-40% change in choice based on frame

#### Priming
- [ ] Semantic priming: Related words before key message
- [ ] Affective priming: Emotion-congruent imagery
- [ ] Conceptual priming: Consistent theme across touchpoints

**Examples:**
- [ ] "Transform. Organize. Execute." before product name
- [ ] Happy faces near positive claims
- [ ] "Fast, efficient, quick" cluster before speed feature

**Expected effect:** 10-20% faster processing and recall

#### Mere Exposure
- [ ] Brand elements repeated 5-10x per session
- [ ] Variety in presentation (same logo, different contexts)
- [ ] Frequency capped at healthy level (not spam)
- [ ] Retargeting limited to 3-7x per day

**Expected effect:** 15-25% increase in brand preference

---

### Copywriting Subliminals

#### Power Words
- [ ] 3-5 power words in headline
- [ ] Sensory language used (visual, tactile, auditory)
- [ ] Action verbs (not passive voice)
- [ ] Specific numbers (not vague claims)

**Examples:**
- [ ] "Unleash", "Transform", "Discover", "Secret", "Proven"
- [ ] "Silky smooth", "Crystal clear", "Crisp sound"

**Expected effect:** 15-30% increase in engagement

#### Temporal Presupposition
- [ ] "When you..." not "If you..."
- [ ] "After you..." not "Should you..."
- [ ] "Once you've..." not "If you decide to..."

**Expected effect:** 10-20% reduction in purchase resistance

#### Embedded Commands
- [ ] Commands nested in context (not overt)
- [ ] Pattern: "People find when they [COMMAND] they [BENEFIT]"

**Examples:**
- [ ] "Many customers find when they UPGRADE NOW they get best results"
- [ ] "Users report when they TRY IT TODAY they wonder why they waited"

**Expected effect:** 5-15% increase in compliance (subtle effect)

#### Ownership Language
- [ ] "Your dashboard", "Your results", "Your team"
- [ ] Creates endowment effect before purchase
- [ ] Used in CTAs: "Start MY trial", "Get MY discount"

**Expected effect:** 10-20% increase in conversion

---

### Audio Subliminals (if applicable)

#### Music Selection
- [ ] Tempo matches desired behavior:
  - Slow (60-72 BPM): Browsing, luxury
  - Medium (80-95 BPM): Comfortable pace
  - Fast (100-120 BPM): Energy, quick decisions

- [ ] Genre matches brand:
  - Classical: Premium, sophisticated
  - Jazz: Creative, urban, mature
  - Acoustic: Authentic, organic
  - Electronic: Modern, tech

**Expected effect:** 20-35% change in pace/time spent

#### Voice Characteristics
- [ ] Pitch matches message:
  - Lower (male): Authority, trust, B2B
  - Moderate (female): Warmth, care, empathy
- [ ] Speaking rate: 160 wpm for persuasion
- [ ] No vocal fry or uptalk

**Expected effect:** 15-25% increase in trust/persuasiveness

#### Strategic Silence
- [ ] 1-2 second pauses after key points
- [ ] Silence before important information
- [ ] Not excessive (>3 seconds = uncomfortable)

**Expected effect:** 15-20% better retention

#### Sonic Branding
- [ ] Consistent audio signature across touchpoints
- [ ] 1-5 seconds maximum (memorability)
- [ ] Simple enough to hum/remember
- [ ] Matches brand personality

**Expected effect:** 25-50% faster brand recognition

- [ ] Note what NOT to do (dark patterns to avoid)

#### Technique Selection
- [ ] Choose 3-5 primary techniques per page/email
- [ ] Don't overload (too many = cluttered, suspicious)
- [ ] Match techniques to decision context
- [ ] Prioritize by expected impact

### Phase 2: Design and Copywriting

#### Visual Design

#### Copy Development
- [ ] Write semantic priming headlines
- [ ] Add anchoring elements (numbers, comparisons)
- [ ] Frame benefits (gain or loss)
- [ ] Integrate power words and sensory language
- [ ] Use ownership language in CTAs

#### Social Proof
- [ ] Collect specific numbers (users, reviews, results)
