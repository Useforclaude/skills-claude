## Introduction to Anchoring

### What is Anchoring?

**Anchoring effect** = First number encountered becomes mental "anchor" that biases all subsequent numeric judgments

**Discovered by:** Amos Tversky & Daniel Kahneman (1974)

**Key characteristics:**
- **Unconscious:** People don't realize they're influenced
- **Powerful:** Works even with obviously irrelevant anchors
- **Universal:** Affects experts and novices alike
- **Persistent:** Hard to overcome even when aware of it

### The Classic Wheel of Fortune Study

**Tversky & Kahneman (1974):**

**Procedure:**
```
1. Spin wheel numbered 1-100 (rigged to land on 10 or 65)
2. Ask: "What percentage of African nations are in the UN?"
3. Record estimates
```

**Results:**
```
Wheel landed on 10 → Median estimate: 25%
Wheel landed on 65 → Median estimate: 45%

Actual answer: ~30%
```

**Key insight:**
- Participants KNEW wheel was random
- Anchor still influenced estimates
- Effect unconscious and automatic

### Why Anchoring Works

**Insufficient adjustment hypothesis:**
```
Process:
1. See anchor (e.g., $1000)
2. Unconsciously use as starting point
3. Adjust up or down based on other info
4. Stop adjusting too soon (insufficient adjustment)
5. Final estimate biased toward anchor
```

**Selective accessibility:**
```
Anchor activates anchor-consistent information:

High anchor ($1000) → Think of reasons price could be high
Low anchor ($100) → Think of reasons price could be low

Result: Confirmation bias supporting anchor
```

### Types of Anchors

**1. External anchors:**
```
Provided by environment:
- List price: "Was $999, now $599"
- Competitor price: "Others charge $5000"
- Reference point: "Average person spends $200/month"
```

**2. Internal anchors:**
```
Self-generated:
- Past experience: "I paid $X last time"
- Budget: "I have $X to spend"
- Category expectation: "These usually cost $X"
```

**3. Arbitrary anchors:**
```
Completely irrelevant:
- Social Security number digits
- Random numbers
- Unrelated prices

STILL INFLUENCE (unconsciously)!
```

## Introduction to Framing

### What is Framing?

**Framing effect** = How information is presented influences decisions, even when underlying facts are identical

**Core principle:**
```
Same information + Different presentation = Different decisions

Example:
"90% survival rate" ≠ "10% mortality rate" (emotionally)
(Logically identical, psychologically different)
```

### Types of Framing

**1. Gain vs Loss Framing**

**Kahneman & Tversky (1979) - Prospect Theory:**

**Key insight: Losses loom larger than gains**

```
Loss aversion ratio: ~2:1

Losing $100 hurts 2x more than gaining $100 feels good

Result: People more motivated to avoid losses than acquire gains
```

**Example:**
```
Gain frame: "Save $100 with this plan"
Loss frame: "Don't lose $100 by choosing wrong plan"

Loss frame more motivating (but can backfire if too threatening)
```

**2. Positive vs Negative Framing**

**Same fact, opposite emphasis:**

```
Medical treatment:
Positive: "90% survival rate"
Negative: "10% mortality rate"

Result: Positive frame → More likely to choose treatment
```

```
Food product:
Positive: "95% fat-free"
Negative: "5% fat"

Result: Positive frame → Perceived as healthier
```

**3. Attribute Framing**

**Emphasize different attributes:**

```
Yogurt example:
Frame A: "Contains 10g of protein!"
Frame B: "Only 150 calories!"

Same product, different emphasis
→ Appeals to different consumer goals
```

**4. Goal Framing**

**Emphasize achieving goal vs avoiding failure:**

```
Exercise campaign:
Achievement frame: "Get fit and healthy!"
Prevention frame: "Avoid heart disease and diabetes!"

Result: Prevention frame stronger for health behaviors
```

## Classic Research Studies

### Anchoring Studies

**Study 1: Real Estate Anchoring (Northcraft & Neale, 1987)**

**Participants:** Real estate agents (experts!)

**Procedure:**
```
1. Tour same house
2. Given different "list prices":
   - Group A: $119,900
   - Group B: $149,900
3. Estimate "fair market value"
```

**Results:**
```
Low anchor ($119,900) → Avg estimate: $114,204
High anchor ($149,900) → Avg estimate: $128,754

Difference: $14,550 (12.7% difference!)

Note: EXPERTS still anchored!
```

**Key lesson:** Expertise doesn't eliminate anchoring

**Study 2: Retail Price Anchoring (Wansink, Kent, & Hoch, 1998)**

**Procedure:**
```
Campbell's Soup display:

Condition A: "No limit"
Condition B: "Limit 12 per person"
```

**Results:**
```
No limit → Avg purchase: 3.3 cans
Limit 12 → Avg purchase: 7.0 cans

(People anchored on "12" as suggested quantity!)
```

**Study 3: First Offer in Negotiation (Galinsky & Mussweiler, 2001)**

**Finding:**
```
First offer strongly predicts final price

Seller should make first offer (high anchor)
Buyer should make first offer (low anchor)

Effect: ~50% of distance between anchor and fair value

Example:
Fair value = $100
Seller opens at $150 → Final price ≈ $125
Buyer opens at $50 → Final price ≈ $75
```

### Framing Studies

**Study 4: Asian Disease Problem (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981)**

**Scenario:**
```
"A disease will kill 600 people. Choose a program:"
```

**Gain frame:**
```
Program A: "200 will be saved" → 72% choose
Program B: "1/3 chance all saved, 2/3 chance none saved" → 28% choose
```

**Loss frame (same outcomes mathematically!):**
```
Program C: "400 will die" → 22% choose
Program D: "1/3 chance none die, 2/3 chance all die" → 78% choose
```

**Result:** Frame changes choice from 72% to 22%!

**Study 5: Medical Treatment Framing (McNeil et al., 1982)**

**Scenario: Surgery vs Radiation for lung cancer**

**Survival frame:**
```
"Surgery: 90% alive after 5 years"
"Radiation: 77% alive after 5 years"

Result: 84% chose surgery
```

**Mortality frame:**
```
"Surgery: 10% dead after 5 years"
"Radiation: 23% dead after 5 years"

Result: 56% chose surgery
```

**Impact:** Frame changed choice by 28 percentage points!

**Study 6: Beef Fat Framing (Levin & Gaeth, 1988)**

**Procedure:**
```
Same ground beef, different labels:

Group A: "75% lean"
Group B: "25% fat"

Taste test and quality ratings
```

**Results:**
```
"75% lean":
- Rated better tasting
- Rated higher quality
- Willing to pay more

"25% fat":
- Rated worse tasting
- Rated lower quality
- Willing to pay less

(Identical product!)
```

## Neural and Cognitive Mechanisms

### Anchoring Mechanism: Insufficient Adjustment

**How brain processes anchors:**

**Step 1: Encoding**
```
See anchor: $1000
Brain: "That's a possible answer"
```

**Step 2: Adjustment**
```
Think: "Is $1000 right?"
→ "Seems high, adjust down"
→ "Maybe $800?"
→ "Still high... $700?"
→ "That feels about right" [STOP]
```

**Step 3: Insufficient adjustment**
```
Stop adjustment too soon
Final estimate ($700) still biased toward anchor ($1000)

If anchor was $500:
→ Adjust up to maybe $600
→ Final estimate lower
```

**Why stop too soon?**
- Cognitive effort (adjustment requires work)
- Satisficing (find "good enough" answer)
- Uncertainty (don't know true value)

### Framing Mechanism: Reference Dependence

**Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979):**

**Value function:**
```
         Gains
           ↑
           |    ╱
           |  ╱
           |╱___________→
      ╲    |
        ╲  |
         ╲ |
         Losses

Key features:
1. S-shaped (not linear)
2. Steeper for losses (loss aversion)
3. Diminishing sensitivity (marginal impact decreases)
```

**Implication:**
```
Moving from 0 to +$100: Large psychological impact
Moving from +$100 to +$200: Smaller impact (diminishing sensitivity)

Moving from 0 to -$100: VERY large impact (loss aversion)
Moving from -$100 to -$200: Smaller than first $100 (but still large)

Result: Framing as gain vs loss dramatically changes perception
```

### Neural Evidence

**fMRI studies show:**

**Gain frames activate:**
- Ventral striatum (reward system)
- Nucleus accumbens (anticipation)
- Medial prefrontal cortex (positive valuation)

**Loss frames activate:**
- Amygdala (threat/fear)
- Anterior insula (disgust/aversion)
- Higher activation intensity than gains

**Anchoring shows:**
- Reduced adjustment in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (less deliberation)
- Automatic activation in posterior cortex (unconscious processing)

## Anchoring Applications in Marketing

### Application 1: Price Anchoring

**Tactic: Original Price Display**

**Implementation:**
```
❌ Weak:
$599

✅ Strong:
Was $999
Now $599
Save $400!

Anchor: $999 → $599 feels like bargain
```

**Research-backed effect:**
- 20-30% increase in willingness to pay
- Works even when consumers know "original" price inflated

**Ethical boundary:**
```
✅ Legal: Compare to real competitor prices
⚠️ Gray zone: Compare to "manufacturer suggested retail"
❌ Illegal: Fake inflated "original" price
```

**Tactic: Tiered Pricing with Extreme Anchor**

**Implementation:**
```
Pricing page:

❌ Weak:
Basic: $10/month
Pro: $30/month

✅ Strong (with extreme anchor):
Basic: $10/month
Pro: $30/month
Enterprise: $500/month ← Extreme anchor

Effect: $30 looks reasonable compared to $500
(Most customers don't want Enterprise, but it makes Pro look affordable)
```

**Decoy effect variation:**
```
Basic: $10/month (limited features)
Pro: $30/month (best value)
Premium: $50/month (slightly more features than Pro)

Result: Pro looks like best deal (anchored between cheap and expensive)
```

**Tactic: Temporal Anchoring**

**Implementation:**
```
❌ Weak:
"Fast delivery"

✅ Strong (with anchor):
"Most solutions take 6 months to implement.
Ours is ready in 2 weeks."

Anchor: 6 months → 2 weeks feels instant
```

**Tactic: Quantity Anchoring**

**Implementation:**
```
Grocery store display:

❌ Weak:
"Soup on sale!"

✅ Strong:
"Soup on sale! Limit 12 per customer"

Effect: 12 = anchor for quantity → people buy more
(Even though they don't buy 12, they buy 7 instead of 3)
```

**Research:** Wansink et al. (1998) - Average purchase increased 112%!

### Application 2: Feature Anchoring

**Tactic: Competitor Comparison**

**Implementation:**
```
❌ Weak:
"We have 50 features"

✅ Strong (with anchor):
"While competitors offer 10-15 features,
we include 50 features."

Anchor: 10-15 → 50 feels abundant
```

**Tactic: Time/Effort Anchoring**

**Implementation:**
```
❌ Weak:
"Easy setup"

✅ Strong:
"Instead of 40 hours of manual setup,
our automated process takes 5 minutes."

Anchor: 40 hours → 5 minutes feels miraculous
```

### Application 3: First Impression Anchoring

**Tactic: Homepage Hero Section**

**Principle:** First number seen becomes anchor for all subsequent valuations

**Implementation:**
```
✅ Option A (High value anchor):
Hero: "Join 500,000+ users"
↓
Pricing: $99/month

(500,000 anchors "successful/popular" → $99 seems reasonable)

✅ Option B (High savings anchor):
Hero: "Save $10,000/year on [problem]"
↓
Pricing: $99/month

($10,000 anchor → $99 feels tiny)
```

**A/B test to find optimal anchor for your market**

## Framing Applications in Marketing

### Application 1: Gain vs Loss Framing

**When to use each:**

**Gain framing:**
```
✅ Use when:
- Promoting prevention products (health, insurance)
- Audience is risk-averse
- Building aspirational brand
- Positive mood context

Example: "Protect your family's future with life insurance"
```

**Loss framing:**
```
✅ Use when:
- Creating urgency
- Audience is risk-seeking
- Highlighting competitor disadvantage
- Problem-aware market

Example: "Don't lose customers to slow website speed"
```

**Meta-analysis findings (Ganzach & Karsahi, 1995):**
```
Detection tasks (health screenings, security): Loss frame wins
Recovery tasks (treatments, solutions): Gain frame wins

Explanation:
- Loss frame motivates avoidance behavior (screening, prevention)
- Gain frame motivates approach behavior (treatment, investment)
```

### Application 2: Positive vs Negative Framing

**Same fact, different emphasis:**

**Product quality:**
```
Negative frame: "Only 2% defect rate"
Positive frame: "98% perfect quality"

Research: Positive frame increases purchase intent 15-20%
```

**Success rate:**
```
Negative frame: "10% of users don't see results"
Positive frame: "90% of users see results"

Effect: Positive frame feels more successful
```

**Efficiency:**
```
Negative frame: "Reduces waste by 30%"
Positive frame: "Increases efficiency by 43%"

(Same improvement, framed from different baselines)
```

### Application 3: Temporal Framing

**Annual vs Monthly vs Daily:**

```
Same price, different frames:

$1,200/year
$100/month
$3.29/day
$0.14/hour (for 24/7 service)

Research: Smaller unit = higher willingness to pay
(Daily/hourly feels negligible)
```

**Best practice:**
```
High-priced items: Frame in smallest unit
- Car: $/month not total price
- Insurance: $/day not $/year
- SaaS: $/user/month not total contract value

Low-priced items: Frame to emphasize value
- Coffee: $3/day → $1,095/year ("You're spending too much!")
```

### Application 4: Scarcity Framing

**Availability framing:**

```
❌ Weak:
"Limited stock"

✅ Loss frame:
"Only 3 left in stock - don't miss out"

✅ Gain frame:
"Get yours before they're gone"
```

**Research (Cialdini, 2006):**
- Loss-framed scarcity increases urgency
- Works best when scarcity is genuine

**Ethical requirement:** Scarcity must be REAL

### Application 5: Social Proof Framing

**Membership framing:**

```
❌ Weak:
"Join our community"

✅ Similarity frame:
"Join 50,000 marketers like you"

✅ Exclusivity frame:
"Join the top 1% of performers"

✅ Momentum frame:
"5,000 people joined this week"
```

**Different frames appeal to different motivations:**
- Similarity: Belonging, validation
- Exclusivity: Status, achievement
- Momentum: FOMO, trend-following

---

## Combined Techniques

### Anchoring + Framing Together

**Strategy 1: Anchor high, frame savings**

```
Original price: $999 (anchor)
Your price: $599
Save: $400 (loss-framed: "Don't lose $400 by waiting")

Combined effect:
- Anchor makes $599 feel low
- Loss frame creates urgency
- Savings framed as loss to avoid
```

**Strategy 2: Feature anchor + benefit framing**

```
Headline: "While competitors offer 5 features (anchor),
we include 25 features (comparison)
giving you 5x more value" (gain frame)

Breakdown:
- Anchor: 5 features (competitor)
- Comparison: 25 features (you)
- Frame: "5x more value" (multiplicative gain)
```

**Strategy 3: Time anchor + efficiency framing**

```
"Most solutions take 40 hours to implement (anchor).
Ours takes 2 hours (comparison).
Save 38 hours on setup" (gain frame)
"Don't waste 38 hours on complicated setup" (loss frame)

Test both frames to see which converts better
```

### Multi-Step Anchoring

**Progressive anchoring:**

```
Step 1: Category anchor
"Enterprise software typically costs $50,000-$100,000/year"

Step 2: Reframe downward
"Small business solutions range from $5,000-$20,000"

Step 3: Position product
"We're $8,000/year - affordable for small business, powerful as enterprise"

Effect:
- First anchor ($50-100K) makes $8K feel tiny
- Second anchor ($5-20K) makes $8K feel reasonable
- Double anchoring reinforces value perception
```

### Framing Sequences

**Problem-Agitate-Solve with Framing:**

```
Problem (loss frame):
"You're losing $5,000/month to inefficient processes"
(Anchor: $5,000 + Loss frame)

Agitate (magnify loss):
"That's $60,000/year - almost a full-time salary wasted"
(Reframe loss in annual terms)

Solve (gain frame):
"Our automation saves $60,000/year - like hiring someone for free"
(Flip to gain frame, use anchor from problem)
```

---

## Debiasing Strategies

### How to Resist Anchoring (Defense)

**Technique 1: Consider the Opposite**

```
When you see an anchor, actively generate opposite anchor:

See: "Was $999"
Think: "What if it was $99? Would I still buy?"

Effect: Reduces anchor influence by providing counterweight
```

**Technique 2: Use Absolute Criteria**

```
Before seeing any prices:
- Define budget: "I will spend max $X"
- Define needs: "I need features A, B, C"
- Define value: "Worth it if provides X outcome"

Then evaluate against criteria, not anchors
```

**Technique 3: Delay Judgment**

```
See anchor → Don't judge immediately
Wait 24-48 hours
Research alternatives
THEN make judgment

Effect: Anchor decays over time, reducing influence
```

**Technique 4: Seek Multiple References**

```
Don't rely on single anchor:
- Check 5+ competitor prices
- Read 10+ reviews
- Compare features across 3+ options

Effect: Multiple anchors average out, reducing any single anchor's power
```

### How to Frame-Resist (Defense)

**Technique 1: Reframe Deliberately**

```
See: "90% success rate"
Reframe: "10% failure rate"

See: "Save $100"
Reframe: "Costs $100 more than cheapest option"

Effect: Seeing both frames reduces influence of either
```

**Technique 2: Quantify Absolutely**

```
Don't think in percentages (easy to frame):
Think in absolute numbers

"90% success" → "900 out of 1000 succeed, 100 fail"
(Harder to manipulate with framing)
```

**Technique 3: Identify Frame Type**

```
Ask yourself:
- Is this gain or loss framed?
- Why did they choose this frame?
- What's the opposite frame?
- Which frame is more informative?

Awareness reduces automatic influence
```

## Ethical Guidelines

### Ethical Anchoring

**✅ ETHICAL:**

**1. True comparative anchors:**
```
"Competitor A charges $500" (if TRUE)
"Industry average is $300" (if ACCURATE)
"We used to charge $200" (if HISTORICAL FACT)
```

**2. Functional anchors:**
```
"Saves 10 hours vs manual process" (if MEASURED)
"3x faster than alternative" (if TESTED)
"Reduce costs by $5000/year" (if CALCULABLE)
```

**3. Transparent anchors:**
```
"We're comparing to [specific competitor]"
"Based on [specific research/data]"
"Calculated using [specific methodology]"
```

**❌ UNETHICAL:**

**1. Fake anchors:**
```
"Originally $999" when never sold at that price
"Retail value $500" when no retailer charges that
"Competitor charges $X" when they don't
```

**2. Manipulative anchors:**
```
Showing irrelevant number before price to anchor high
Using social security numbers, phone numbers as anchors
Exploiting arbitrary number availability
```

**3. Deceptive comparison:**
```
Comparing premium version to competitor basic
Comparing annual price to competitor monthly
Comparing features not actually comparable
```

### Ethical Framing

**✅ ETHICAL:**

**1. Balanced framing:**
```
Present both frames when material:
"90% success rate (10% don't see results)"
"Save $100 (costs $100 more than cheapest option)"
```

**2. Informative framing:**
```
Choose frame that best informs decision:
Medical: "90% survive" (positive frame reduces anxiety)
Risk warning: "10% risk of side effects" (negative frame ensures informed consent)
```

**3. Audience-appropriate:**
```
Risk-averse audience: Gain frame
Risk-seeking audience: Loss frame
Match frame to audience need, not just conversion
```

**❌ UNETHICAL:**

**1. Deceptive framing:**
```
"Fat-free!" (but loaded with sugar)
"All-natural!" (natural doesn't mean safe)
"Chemical-free!" (impossible, water is a chemical)
```

**2. Exploitative framing:**
```
Using loss frames to scare vulnerable populations
Framing to hide material risks
Framing to bypass informed consent
```

**3. Contradictory framing:**
```
Marketing: "Effective in 90% of cases!"
Fine print: "Individual results vary, no guarantee"
(Frame and disclosure contradict)
```

### Ethical Decision Framework

**Before using anchoring/framing, ask:**

**Anchoring check:**
- [ ] Is anchor based on true fact?
- [ ] Can I substantiate comparison?
- [ ] Would anchor be defensible if publicized?
- [ ] Does anchor help or deceive customer?

**Framing check:**
- [ ] Is framed information complete?
- [ ] Am I hiding material information through framing?
- [ ] Would opposite frame change decision significantly?
- [ ] Is frame appropriate for decision type?

**Overall:**
- [ ] Would I want this technique used on me?
- [ ] Can customer make informed choice despite technique?
- [ ] Am I optimizing for customer value or just conversion?

**If all ✅ → Proceed**
**If any ❌ → Revise or abandon**

## Key Takeaways

### Anchoring

**What works:**
- ✅ First number strongly influences estimates
- ✅ Works even when anchor is irrelevant
- ✅ Experts also susceptible
- ✅ Effect size: 10-30% bias toward anchor

**Applications:**
- Price anchoring (original price, competitor price)
- Feature anchoring (competitor comparison)
- Quantity anchoring (purchase limits)
- Time anchoring (competitor timelines)

**Ethics:**
- Use TRUE anchors only
- Transparent comparisons
- Help calibration, don't deceive

### Framing

**What works:**
- ✅ Gain vs loss frames change decisions dramatically
- ✅ Positive framing increases preference
- ✅ Loss framing creates urgency
- ✅ Effect size: 20-40% difference in choices

**Applications:**
- Gain frame: Aspirational, prevention, risk-averse
- Loss frame: Urgency, action, risk-seeking
- Positive frame: Quality, success rates, benefits
- Temporal frame: Make expensive seem cheap

**Ethics:**
- Present balanced frames for major decisions
- Match frame to audience need
- Don't hide information through framing

### Combined Power

**Anchoring + Framing = Subliminal Persuasion**

Both work unconsciously:
- Customer doesn't notice influence
- Effects automatic, hard to resist
- Combine for maximum impact

But with great power comes great responsibility:
- Use to inform, not deceive
- Help good decisions, don't exploit
- Transparent when asked

**Master these techniques. Use them ethically.** 🎯
