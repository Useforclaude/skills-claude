## 1. What is Priming?

### Definition

> **Priming:** Exposure to one stimulus (the prime) influences response to a subsequent stimulus (the target), without conscious intention to connect them.

### Key Characteristics

**Differences from Subliminal:**
- ✅ Prime is **consciously perceptible** (you can see/hear it)
- ✅ **Legal** in all jurisdictions
- ✅ **More effective** than subliminal (larger effect sizes)
- ✅ **Better researched** (more replications)

**How It Works:**
1. Encounter prime stimulus (word, image, sound, smell)
2. Activates related concepts in memory (spreading activation)
3. Primed concepts more accessible
4. Influences subsequent judgments/behavior

**Duration:**
- Short-lived (seconds to minutes)
- Context-dependent
- Individual differences

---

## 2. Types of Priming

### 2.1 Semantic Priming

**Definition:** Words/concepts activate related concepts

**Classic Example:**
- Prime: "Doctor"
- Target: "Nurse" (recognized faster)

**Research:**
- Meyer & Schvaneveldt (1971): Lexical decision task
- Neely (1977): Automatic vs. controlled processing
- **Status:** ✅ Highly replicated

**Marketing Applications:**

**Product Naming:**
- "Häagen-Dazs" (sounds European/premium)
- "Silk" (soy milk — smooth, luxurious)
- "Bounty" (paper towels — abundance)

**Ad Copy:**
- Luxury words prime quality expectations
- "Handcrafted," "artisan," "premium"

**Menu Engineering:**
- "Grandma's Recipe" primes nostalgia/comfort
- "Farm-Fresh" primes natural/healthy

---

### 2.2 Perceptual Priming

**Definition:** Physical features influence recognition

**Types:**

**Visual:**
- Repeated exposure to shape → faster recognition
- Logo consistency → brand recognition

**Auditory:**
- Familiar jingle → brand recall
- Voice consistency → personality perception

**Research:**
- Tulving & Schacter (1990): Implicit memory
- **Status:** ✅ Robust

**Marketing Applications:**

**Logo Design:**
- Consistent visual identity
- Simple shapes (easier to process)
- Color consistency (red = Coca-Cola)

**Audio Branding:**
- Intel "bong"
- McDonald's "I'm lovin' it"
- Netflix "ta-dum"

---

### 2.3 Conceptual Priming

**Definition:** Abstract ideas activate related concepts

**Examples:**
- Prime: "Elderly" → Target: Slower walking (FAILED REPLICATION)
- Prime: "Money" → Target: Selfishness (FAILED REPLICATION)
- Prime: "Sophistication" → Target: Wine preference (REPLICATED)

**Replication Crisis:**
- Many conceptual priming studies failed to replicate
- Be skeptical of spectacular claims

**Reliable Applications:**

**Goal Priming (limited):**
- Health cues → healthier choices (small effect)
- Requires pre-existing goal

**Example:**
- Gym images in cafeteria → slightly healthier food choices
- **Only works if person already cares about health**

---

### 2.4 Affective Priming

**Definition:** Emotional valence influences judgments

**Mechanism:**

---

### 2.5 Response Priming

**Definition:** Motor preparation influences reaction

**Examples:**
