## 1. Foundational Studies

### ✅ Kunst-Wilson & Zajonc (1980) - Mere Exposure Effect

**Study:** "Affective discrimination of stimuli that cannot be recognized"
**Journal:** *Science, 207*(4430), 557-558

**Method:**
- Showed irregular polygons for 1ms (subliminal)
- Tested recognition vs. preference

**Findings:**
- Recognition: At chance (50%)
- Preference: Above chance (60%)
- **Conclusion:** Can prefer without recognizing

**Limitations:**
- Lab setting only
- Abstract stimuli (not brands/products)
- Small effect size
- No evidence of behavior change

**Replications:**
- Bornstein & D'Agostino (1992): Replicated with faces
- Monahan et al. (2000): Replicated with Chinese characters

**Application:**
- Shows unconscious processing exists
- Does NOT support subliminal advertising effectiveness

---

### ✅ Marcel (1983) - Semantic Priming

**Study:** "Conscious and unconscious perception: Experiments on visual masking and word recognition"
**Journal:** *Cognitive Psychology, 15*(2), 197-237

**Method:**
- Flashed words below awareness threshold
- Measured semantic priming effects

**Findings:**
- Subliminal "doctor" primes "nurse"
- Semantic networks activated unconsciously

**Limitations:**
- Requires precise timing (milliseconds)
- Lab-only effects
- No behavioral outcomes measured
- Decay extremely rapid

**Replications:**
- Dehaene et al. (1998): Replicated with numbers
- Greenwald et al. (1996): Replicated but with very small effects

**Application:**
- Evidence for unconscious semantic processing
- No evidence for advertising effectiveness

**Findings:**
- Primed group walked slower
- Unconscious behavior activation

**CRITICAL UPDATE:**
- **Failed to replicate** in multiple studies (Doyen et al., 2012; Pashler et al., 2013)
- Original effect likely due to experimenter bias
- Part of replication crisis

**Status:** ❌ **No longer considered reliable**

**Lesson:**

**Findings:**
- Priming increased choice **only if already thirsty**
- No effect if not thirsty
- Small effect size (55% vs 50%)

**Limitations:**
- Effect requires pre-existing need
- Cannot create motivation
- Lab setting, single choice
- Failed to replicate in some studies

**Application:**
- Subliminal priming cannot override motivation
- At best, slight nudge toward existing desire
- Not practical for advertising

## 4. Replication Crisis

### Overview

**Problem:**

- p-hacking (manipulating data to get significance)
- Small sample sizes

**Impact on Subliminal/Priming Research:**
- Many famous studies did not replicate
- Effects smaller than originally reported
- Some effects may not exist at all

---

### ❌ Failed Replications

**Bargh "Elderly" Priming (1996):**

- Original: Moral primes increase hand-washing
- Replications: Earp et al. (2014) — **Failed**

**Money Priming (Vohs et al., 2006):**
- Original: Money primes increase selfishness
- Replications: Rohrer et al. (2015) — **Failed**

**Flag Priming (Carter et al., 2011):**

---

### ✅ Successful Replications

**Stroop Effect (1935):** Consistently replicated
**Mere Exposure Effect (Zajonc, 1968):** Replicated with caveats
**Anchoring Effect (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974):** Robust
**Priming of Semantic Networks (Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971):** Replicated

---

### Key Lesson

> **Not all published research is reliable. Replications matter.**

**Before trusting a study:**
1. Has it been replicated?
2. What is the sample size?
3. Is the effect size meaningful?
4. Could there be alternative explanations?
