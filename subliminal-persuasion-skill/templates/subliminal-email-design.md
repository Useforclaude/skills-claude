## Design Principles for All Email Templates

### Visual Hierarchy

```
1. SUBJECT LINE: Most important (50% of open rate)
2. PREHEADER: Secondary hook (supports subject)
3. HEADER: Brand consistency
4. HEADLINE: First thing eyes see in email
5. PRIMARY CTA: High contrast, above fold
6. BODY CONTENT: Scannable (bullets, short paragraphs)
7. SECONDARY CTA: Repeat or alternative action
8. FOOTER: Unsubscribe, social, legal
```

### Color Psychology

```
CTA BUTTONS:
- Urgency/Action: Orange/Red
- Trust/Stability: Blue
- Success/Go: Green
- Premium: Black/Gold

BACKGROUNDS:
- Neutral: White/Light gray (most common)
- Urgency sections: Light red/orange
- Trust sections: Light blue
- Success stories: Light green
```

### Spacing and Layout

```
DESKTOP:
- Email width: 600-650px
- White space: 20-30px margins
- Line height: 1.6-1.8
- Paragraph max: 3-4 lines

MOBILE (50%+ of opens):
- Single column layout
- Font size: 16px minimum
- CTA buttons: 44px minimum height (finger-friendly)
- Touch targets: 48px spacing
```

### Subliminal Integration Checklist

Every email should include:

- [ ] **Personalization** ([Name] at least once)
- [ ] **Anchoring** (Specific numbers, comparisons)
- [ ] **Framing** (Gain or loss, context-appropriate)
- [ ] **Social proof** (Numbers, testimonials, authority)
- [ ] **Scarcity/Urgency** (If genuine)
- [ ] **Visual hierarchy** (Clear CTA stands out)
- [ ] **Semantic priming** (Power words in first line)
- [ ] **Ownership language** ("Your", "My", "Get")

### A/B Testing Priority

1. **Subject line** (Biggest impact on opens)
2. **CTA copy and placement**
3. **Email length** (Short vs detailed)
4. **Social proof type** (Numbers vs testimonials)
5. **Framing** (Gain vs loss)

**Use these templates as frameworks. Customize based on your audience, product, and brand voice. Always test and optimize based on your specific data.** 📧🎯
