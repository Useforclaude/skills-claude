## Key Template Principles

### Visual Hierarchy Elements

1. **Size progression:**
   - H1: 48-60px
   - H2: 32-40px
   - H3: 24-28px
   - Body: 16-18px

2. **Contrast:**
   - CTA: High contrast (e.g., orange on blue)
   - Headings: Dark
   - Body: Medium gray
   - Background: Light

3. **White space:**
   - Premium: 60-80% white space
   - Standard: 40-50%
   - Budget: 20-30%

### Subliminal Integration Checklist

Each section should include at least 3:

- [ ] Semantic priming (power words before key message)
- [ ] Anchoring (specific numbers, comparisons)
- [ ] Framing (gain or loss, depending on context)
- [ ] Gaze direction (if using human images)
- [ ] Social proof (specific numbers, authority)
- [ ] Visual hierarchy (size, color, contrast)
- [ ] Directional cues (arrows on CTAs)
- [ ] White space (premium perception if appropriate)

### Color Scheme Selection

**Trust/Professional:** Blue-dominant
**Energy/Action:** Red/Orange accents
**Premium/Luxury:** Black/Gold with lots of white space
**Natural/Organic:** Green/Earth tones
**Creative/Youth:** Purple/Bright colors

### A/B Testing Priority

Test in this order:
1. **Headline** (biggest impact)
2. **CTA copy and color**
3. **Price anchoring strategy**
4. **Social proof placement**
5. **Image selection and gaze direction**

**Use these templates as starting points. Customize subliminal elements based on your specific product, audience, and brand positioning.** 🎯
