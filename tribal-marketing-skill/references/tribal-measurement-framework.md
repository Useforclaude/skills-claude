# Tribal Marketing Measurement Framework: Metrics, KPIs & Analytics

**Purpose**: Comprehensive system for measuring tribal strength, tracking tribal growth, and optimizing tribal marketing ROI.

**Why This Matters**: "You can't manage what you don't measure." Tribal marketing requires different metrics than traditional marketing. Standard metrics (CTR, conversion rate) miss the deeper tribal dynamics that drive long-term value.

**What You'll Learn**:
- 40+ tribal-specific metrics with calculation formulas
- Tribal Strength Score (TSS) comprehensive framework
- Tracking dashboards and measurement systems
- Benchmarks across industries
- Early warning indicators for tribal decay

## 🎯 Core Principle: Traditional Metrics Miss Tribal Value

### Why Standard Marketing Metrics Fail for Tribes

**Traditional Marketing Mindset**:
- **Goal**: Convert as many people as possible
- **Metrics**: CTR, conversion rate, CPA
- **Success**: High volume, low cost

**Tribal Marketing Mindset**:
- **Goal**: Build deeply loyal core tribe
- **Metrics**: Engagement depth, advocacy rate, tribal pride
- **Success**: High LTV, self-sustaining community

**Example Comparison**:

| Metric | Brand A (Traditional) | Brand B (Tribal) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|
| Customers | 100,000 | 10,000 |
| Average order value | $50 | $200 |
| Repeat purchase rate | 25% | 85% |
| Referrals per customer | 0.3 | 4.2 |
| Brand tattoos/symbols | 0 | 800 people |
| Lifetime value | $75 | $3,400 |
| **Total business value** | **$7.5M** | **$34M** |

**Brand B wins with 10x fewer customers** because tribal loyalty creates exponentially more value.

### Overview

**TSS (0-100)** = Weighted average of 7 tribal dimensions:
1. **Engagement Intensity** (20%)
2. **Advocacy & Evangelism** (20%)
3. **Tribal Identity Adoption** (15%)
4. **Community Cohesion** (15%)

- **60-74**: Emerging tribe (positive but vulnerable)
- **40-59**: Weak tribal signals (at risk)
- **0-39**: No meaningful tribe (traditional customer base)

---

### DIMENSION 1: Engagement Intensity (20% of TSS)

**What It Measures**: How deeply tribe members engage with brand and each other

#### Metric 1.1: Engagement Depth Index (EDI)

**Formula**:
```
EDI = (
    (Social media interactions per member per month × 1.0) +
    (User-generated content pieces per member per year × 5.0) +
    (Community forum posts per member per month × 2.0) +
    (Event attendance rate × 100) +
    (Average session duration in minutes ÷ 10)
) ÷ 5
```

**Calculation Example (Apple)**:
```
Social interactions: 8/month × 1.0 = 8
UGC pieces: 2/year × 5.0 = 10
Forum posts: 3/month × 2.0 = 6
Event attendance: 12% × 100 = 12
Session duration: 45 min ÷ 10 = 4.5

EDI = (8 + 10 + 6 + 12 + 4.5) ÷ 5 = 40.5 ÷ 5 = 8.1
```

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite (9+): Apple (8.1), CrossFit (9.3), Harley (10.2)
- Strong (6-8.9): Peloton (7.4), Lululemon (6.8)
- Emerging (3-5.9): Nike (5.2), Starbucks (4.7)
- Weak (<3): Most consumer brands (1.2-2.8)

#### Metric 1.2: Active Participation Rate (APR)

**Formula**:
```
APR = (Members who engaged in last 30 days ÷ Total members) × 100
```

**Engagement Definition**: Any of:
- Posted content
- Commented on content
- Attended event
- Made purchase
- Referred someone
- Wore/displayed tribal symbol

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 70%+ (Harley HOG chapters: 73%)
- Strong: 50-69% (CrossFit boxes: 58%)
- Emerging: 30-49% (Peloton: 42%)
- Weak: <30% (Traditional loyalty programs: 8-15%)

#### Metric 1.3: Multi-Channel Engagement Rate

**Formula**:
```
MCER = (Members active on 3+ channels ÷ Total members) × 100
```

**Channels**: Website, app, social media, email, in-person events, community forum, retail

**Why It Matters**: Tribal members engage across multiple touchpoints (not just one)

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 45%+ (Apple ecosystem users: 52%)
- Strong: 30-44% (Sephora Beauty Insider: 38%)
- Emerging: 15-29%
- Weak: <15%

#### DIMENSION 1 SCORE CALCULATION:

```
Engagement Intensity Score (0-100) = (
    (EDI × 10) × 0.4 +
    APR × 0.4 +
    MCER × 0.2
)
```

**TSS Contribution**: Engagement Intensity Score × 0.20

---

### DIMENSION 2: Advocacy & Evangelism (20% of TSS)

**What It Measures**: How actively tribe members recruit and defend the tribe

#### Metric 2.1: Net Promoter Score (NPS) - Tribal Edition

**Standard NPS Formula**:
```
NPS = % Promoters (9-10) - % Detractors (0-6)
```

**Tribal NPS adds**:
- **Active Evangelists**: Promoters who ALSO recruited 3+ people in last year
- **Tribal Defenders**: Promoters who defended brand online/in person

**Enhanced Formula**:
```
Tribal NPS = (
    Standard NPS × 0.5 +
    (% Active Evangelists × 2) × 0.3 +
    (% Tribal Defenders) × 0.2
)
```

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 80+ (Apple: 89, Tesla: 96)
- Strong: 60-79 (Amazon: 73, Costco: 77)
- Emerging: 40-59 (Starbucks: 51)
- Weak: <40 (Most airlines: 8-25)

#### Metric 2.2: Referral Rate & Quality

**Formula**:
```
Referral Rate = (New customers from referrals ÷ Total existing customers) × 100
```

**Quality Multiplier**:
- Referred customers who ALSO become advocates: 2x
- Referred customers who join community: 1.5x
- Referred customers who buy once: 1x

**Example (Dropbox)**:
- Base referral rate: 35% of customers refer someone
- 60% of referred become power users → Quality multiplier: 1.8
- **Effective Referral Rate**: 35% × 1.8 = 63%

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 40%+ effective rate (Tesla: 58%, Dropbox: 63%)
- Strong: 25-39% (CrossFit: 31%)
- Emerging: 10-24% (Airbnb: 18%)
- Weak: <10% (Most brands: 3-8%)

#### Metric 2.3: Unsolicited Advocacy Index (UAI)

**What It Measures**: Brand mentions NOT prompted by brand

**Data Sources**:
- Social media mentions (branded hashtags NOT in brand posts)
- Online reviews (unprompted)
- Forum discussions (Reddit, Quora, etc.)
- Media coverage (earned, not paid)

**Formula**:
```
UAI = (
    (Unsolicited social mentions per month ÷ Total customers) × 1000 +
    (Unsolicited reviews per month ÷ Total customers) × 500 +
    (Forum mentions per month ÷ Total customers) × 200
) ÷ 3
```

**Calculation Example (Patagonia, 1M customers)**:
```
Social mentions: 25,000/month ÷ 1M × 1000 = 25
Reviews: 4,000/month ÷ 1M × 500 = 2
Forum mentions: 8,000/month ÷ 1M × 200 = 1.6

UAI = (25 + 2 + 1.6) ÷ 3 = 9.5
```

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 8+ (Patagonia: 9.5, Supreme: 12.3)
- Strong: 5-7.9 (Lululemon: 6.8)
- Emerging: 2-4.9 (Nike: 3.2)
- Weak: <2 (Most brands: 0.3-1.5)

#### Metric 2.4: Defense Response Rate

**What It Measures**: When brand is criticized, do tribe members defend it?

**Formula**:
```
DRR = (
    (Negative mentions defended by customers ÷ Total negative mentions) × 100
)
```

**Tracking**:
- Monitor social listening for negative brand mentions
- Count how many get responses from customers (not brand)
- Responses defending, explaining, or contextualizing

**Example (Apple "You're Holding It Wrong" iPhone 4, 2010)**:
- Negative mentions: 250,000
- Customer defenses: 180,000 (72%)
- Despite being a REAL product flaw, tribe defended Apple

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 60%+ (Apple: 72%, Tesla: 68%)
- Strong: 40-59% (Patagonia: 51%)
- Emerging: 20-39% (Starbucks: 28%)
- Weak: <20% (Most brands: 2-8%)

#### DIMENSION 2 SCORE CALCULATION:

```
Advocacy Score (0-100) = (
    Tribal NPS × 0.4 +
    (Referral Rate × 2) × 0.3 +
    (UAI × 8) × 0.2 +
    DRR × 0.1
)
```

**TSS Contribution**: Advocacy Score × 0.20

### DIMENSION 3: Tribal Identity Adoption (15% of TSS)

**What It Measures**: Do members IDENTIFY as part of the tribe?

#### Metric 3.1: Tribal Language Usage Rate

**What It Measures**: Do members use tribal terminology?

**Tracking Method**:
- Analyze customer communications (reviews, social media, support tickets)
- Count usage of tribal-specific terms

**Example (CrossFit)**:
- Tribal terms: "WOD", "Box", "Rx'd", "AMRAP", "Metcon"
- Sample: 10,000 customer social posts
- Posts using 2+ tribal terms: 7,200 (72%)

**Formula**:
```
TLUR = (Communications using 2+ tribal terms ÷ Total communications) × 100
```

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 60%+ (CrossFit: 72%, Harley: 68%)
- Strong: 40-59% (Apple: 48% - "ecosystem", "AirDrop", etc.)
- Emerging: 20-39% (Peloton: 31% - "PR", "shoutout", etc.)
- Weak: <20% (Most brands: 5-12%)

#### Metric 3.2: Symbol Display Rate (SDR)

**What It Measures**: Do members visibly display tribal symbols?

**Symbols Include**:
- Logo apparel (t-shirts, hats, etc.)
- Stickers (laptop, car, water bottle)
- Tattoos (ultimate commitment)
- Profile pictures / social media
- Home/office display (posters, art)

**Formula**:
```
SDR = (
    (Members with ANY visible symbol ÷ Total members) × 100 × 0.5 +
    (Members with 3+ symbols ÷ Total members) × 100 × 0.3 +
    (Members with permanent symbols/tattoos ÷ Total members) × 1000 × 0.2
)
```

**Example (Harley-Davidson)**:
```
Any symbol: 85% × 0.5 = 42.5
3+ symbols: 42% × 0.3 = 12.6
Tattoos: 1% × 1000 × 0.2 = 2
SDR = 42.5 + 12.6 + 2 = 57.1
```

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 50+ (Harley: 57.1, Apple: 52.3)
- Strong: 35-49 (Patagonia: 41.2)
- Emerging: 20-34 (Peloton: 28.7)
- Weak: <20 (Most brands: 3-8)

#### Metric 3.3: Identity Affirmation Score (IAS)

**What It Measures**: Do members describe themselves using tribal identity?

**Survey Questions** (1-7 Likert scale):
1. "Being a [Brand] customer is part of who I am"
2. "I see myself as a [Tribe Member] (e.g., 'CrossFitter', 'Apple Person')"
3. "When someone criticizes [Brand], I feel personally criticized"
4. "I proudly tell people I'm a [Brand] customer"
5. "I seek out other [Brand] customers to connect with"

**Formula**:
```
IAS = (Average score across 5 questions ÷ 7) × 100
```

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 75+ (Harley: 83, Apple: 78)
- Strong: 60-74 (Patagonia: 69, CrossFit: 72)
- Emerging: 45-59 (Peloton: 54)
- Weak: <45 (Most brands: 20-35)

#### DIMENSION 3 SCORE CALCULATION:

```
Identity Adoption Score (0-100) = (
    TLUR × 0.3 +
    SDR × 0.4 +
    IAS × 0.3
)
```

**TSS Contribution**: Identity Adoption Score × 0.15

### DIMENSION 4: Community Cohesion (15% of TSS)

**What It Measures**: Do tribe members connect with EACH OTHER (not just brand)?

#### Metric 4.1: Member-to-Member Interaction Rate (MMIR)

**What It Measures**: Interactions between customers (not brand-to-customer)

**Data Sources**:
- Community forum posts/replies
- Social media @ mentions between customers
- Event networking (observed connections)
- User-organized meetups

**Formula**:
```
MMIR = (
    (Member-to-member interactions per month ÷ Total active members) × 10
)
```

**Example (Peloton)**:
- 2M active users
- Forum: 180,000 member replies/month
- Social: 95,000 @mentions between members/month
- Total: 275,000 interactions
- MMIR = (275,000 ÷ 2,000,000) × 10 = 1.375

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 2.5+ (CrossFit boxes: 3.8, Harley HOG: 4.2)
- Strong: 1.5-2.4 (Peloton: 1.9, Sephora: 1.7)
- Emerging: 0.8-1.4 (NikePlus: 1.1)
- Weak: <0.8 (Most brands: 0.1-0.4)

#### Metric 4.2: User-Organized Event Rate (UOER)

**What It Measures**: Events created BY members (not brand)

**Types**:
- Meetups (coffee, rides, workouts)
- Online hangouts (Discord, Zoom)
- Competitions (user-run challenges)
- Charity events (organized by members)

**Formula**:
```
UOER = (User-organized events per quarter ÷ Total members) × 10,000
```

**Example (CrossFit, 5M members globally)**:
- User competitions: 2,400/quarter
- Social meetups: 8,700/quarter
- Charity events: 1,200/quarter
- Total: 12,300 events
- UOER = (12,300 ÷ 5,000,000) × 10,000 = 24.6

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 20+ (CrossFit: 24.6, Harley: 28.3)
- Strong: 10-19 (Peloton: 14.2)
- Emerging: 5-9 (Apple User Groups: 7.8)
- Weak: <5 (Most brands: 0.2-2)

#### Metric 4.3: Tribal Network Density (TND)

**What It Measures**: How interconnected are tribe members?

**Calculation** (requires social network analysis):
```
TND = (Actual connections between members ÷ Possible connections) × 100
```

**Example**:
- Community of 1,000 members
- Possible connections: 1,000 × 999 ÷ 2 = 499,500
- Actual connections (mutual follows, friendships): 25,000
- TND = (25,000 ÷ 499,500) × 100 = 5.0

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 5%+ (tight-knit communities)
- Strong: 2-4.9%
- Emerging: 0.5-1.9%
- Weak: <0.5% (most customer bases: nearly zero)

**Proxy Metrics** (if full network analysis unavailable):
- Average number of mutual connections per member
- % of members who know 5+ other members

#### Metric 4.4: Tribal Support Exchange Rate (TSER)

**What It Measures**: Do members help each other?

**Types of Support**:
- Answering questions in forums
- Troubleshooting help
- Product tips and tricks
- Emotional support / encouragement
- Resource sharing

**Formula**:
```
TSER = (
    (Member-provided answers in forum ÷ Total questions) × 100 × 0.4 +
    (Peer support interactions per member per month × 10) × 0.3 +
    (% of members who've helped another member × 100) × 0.3
)
```

**Example (Apple Support Communities)**:
- Member answers: 85% of questions (85 × 0.4 = 34)
- Support interactions: 2.1/member/month (21 × 0.3 = 6.3)
- Members who helped: 28% (28 × 0.3 = 8.4)
- TSER = 34 + 6.3 + 8.4 = 48.7

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 45+ (Apple Communities: 48.7, CrossFit: 52.1)
- Strong: 30-44 (Peloton: 37.2)
- Emerging: 15-29 (Reddit brand communities: 22)
- Weak: <15 (Brand support forums: 5-12)

#### DIMENSION 4 SCORE CALCULATION:

```
Community Cohesion Score (0-100) = (
    (MMIR × 20) × 0.3 +
    (UOER × 2) × 0.2 +
    (TND × 10) × 0.2 +
    TSER × 0.3
)
```

**TSS Contribution**: Community Cohesion Score × 0.15

---

### DIMENSION 5: Retention & Longevity (15% of TSS)

**What It Measures**: How long do tribe members stay?

#### Metric 5.1: Tribal Retention Rate (TRR)

**Standard Retention**:
```
1-Year Retention = (Customers active at year end ÷ Customers at year start) × 100
```

**Tribal Retention** (multi-year):
```
TRR = (
    1-year retention × 0.2 +
    3-year retention × 0.3 +
    5-year retention × 0.5
)
```

**Why 5-year weighted heaviest**: True tribe members stay LONG-TERM

**Example (Harley-Davidson)**:
```
1-year: 92% (92 × 0.2 = 18.4)
3-year: 87% (87 × 0.3 = 26.1)
5-year: 78% (78 × 0.5 = 39)
TRR = 18.4 + 26.1 + 39 = 83.5
```

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 80+ (Harley: 83.5, Apple iPhone: 86.2)
- Strong: 65-79 (Amazon Prime: 74.3, Costco: 71.8)
- Emerging: 50-64 (Peloton: 58.6)
- Weak: <50 (Most SaaS: 30-45%, Retail: 20-35%)

#### Metric 5.2: Tribal Tenure Distribution

**What It Measures**: Age distribution of tribal membership

**Ideal Tribal Distribution**:
- **New (<1 year)**: 20-30% (growth)
- **Emerging (1-3 years)**: 25-35% (deepening)
- **Core (3-5 years)**: 20-30% (stability)
- **Veterans (5-10 years)**: 15-25% (foundation)
- **Lifers (10+ years)**: 5-15% (tribal elders)

**Red Flag Distributions**:
- 60%+ new members → Leaky bucket (poor retention)
- 70%+ veterans → No growth (dying tribe)

**Health Score**:
```
Tenure Health = 100 - (
    |New % - 25| +
    |Emerging % - 30| +
    |Core % - 25| +
    |Veterans % - 15| +
    |Lifers % - 5|
)
```

**Example (Apple)**:
```
New: 22% (|22-25| = 3)
Emerging: 28% (|28-30| = 2)
Core: 27% (|27-25| = 2)
Veterans: 18% (|18-15| = 3)
Lifers: 5% (|5-5| = 0)

Tenure Health = 100 - (3+2+2+3+0) = 100 - 10 = 90
```

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 85+ (balanced growth + retention)
- Strong: 70-84
- Emerging: 55-69
- Weak: <55 (unbalanced)

#### Metric 5.3: Increasing Engagement Trajectory (IET)

**What It Measures**: Do members get MORE engaged over time?

**Calculation**:
- Track engagement score per member monthly
- Compare month 12 vs month 1 (year 1)
- Compare year 5 vs year 1 (long-term)

**Formula**:
```
IET = (
    Average engagement score at 1 year ÷ Engagement at month 1
) × 100 - 100
```

**Example (CrossFit)**:
- Month 1 engagement: 3.2 (visits/week)
- Month 12 engagement: 4.8 (visits/week)
- IET = (4.8 ÷ 3.2) × 100 - 100 = 50% increase

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: +40% or more (CrossFit: +50%, Peloton: +43%)
- Strong: +20% to +39% (Apple: +28%)
- Emerging: +5% to +19% (Amazon Prime: +12%)
- Weak: <+5% or negative (Most brands: -10% to +5%)

**Interpretation**:
- Positive IET → Tribal deepening (good!)
- Flat IET → Transactional relationship
- Negative IET → Engagement decay (churn risk)

#### DIMENSION 5 SCORE CALCULATION:

```
Retention & Longevity Score (0-100) = (
    TRR × 0.5 +
    Tenure Health × 0.3 +
    (IET + 100) ÷ 2 × 0.2
)
```

**TSS Contribution**: Retention & Longevity Score × 0.15

---

### DIMENSION 6: Value Creation (10% of TSS)

**What It Measures**: Economic value of tribal loyalty

#### Metric 6.1: Tribal Lifetime Value (Tribal LTV)

**Standard LTV**:
```
LTV = Average purchase value × Purchase frequency × Customer lifespan
```

**Tribal LTV adds**:
- Referral value (new customers brought in)
- Advocacy value (unpaid marketing)
- Co-creation value (UGC, feedback)

**Formula**:
```
Tribal LTV = (
    Standard LTV × 1.0 +
    (Referrals × New customer LTV × 0.2) +
    (Advocacy impressions ÷ 1000 × CPM equivalent) +
    (UGC pieces × Content production cost)
)
```

**Example (Patagonia tribal member)**:
```
Standard LTV: $1,800 (purchases over 10 years)
Referrals: 5 people × $1,800 × 0.2 = $1,800
Advocacy: 50,000 impressions ÷ 1000 × $15 CPM = $750
UGC: 8 pieces × $200 = $1,600

Tribal LTV = $1,800 + $1,800 + $750 + $1,600 = $5,950
```

**Tribal LTV is 3.3x Standard LTV**

**Benchmarks (Tribal LTV ÷ Standard LTV)**:
- Elite: 4x+ (Harley: 6.2x, Tesla: 5.8x)
- Strong: 2.5-3.9x (Apple: 3.4x, Patagonia: 3.3x)
- Emerging: 1.5-2.4x (Peloton: 2.1x)
- Weak: <1.5x (Most brands: 1.0-1.2x)

#### Metric 6.2: Tribal Premium Willingness (TPW)

**What It Measures**: How much MORE will tribe members pay vs non-members?

**Method**:
- Survey: "How much would you pay for [Product]?"
- Compare tribal members vs non-tribal customers
- Calculate premium %

**Formula**:
```
TPW = (
    (Tribal member WTP - Non-tribal WTP) ÷ Non-tribal WTP
) × 100
```

**Example (Apple iPhone)**:
- Tribal members (5+ Apple products): WTP $1,200
- Non-tribal (first Apple product): WTP $850
- TPW = (($1,200 - $850) ÷ $850) × 100 = 41.2%

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 40%+ (Apple: 41%, Patagonia: 47%)
- Strong: 25-39% (Lululemon: 32%)
- Emerging: 10-24% (Nike: 18%)
- Weak: <10% (Commodity brands: 0-5%)

#### Metric 6.3: Price Insensitivity Index (PII)

**What It Measures**: Do tribe members continue buying during price increases?

**Tracking**:
- Measure retention rate during price increase
- Compare to retention rate without price change

**Formula**:
```
PII = (
    (Retention rate during +10% price increase ÷ Baseline retention) × 100
)
```

**Example (Netflix, 2023 price increase)**:
- Baseline retention: 94%
- During +$3 increase: 89%
- PII = (89 ÷ 94) × 100 = 94.7

**Interpretation**:
- PII near 100 = Tribe doesn't care about price
- PII < 80 = Price-sensitive (weak tribe)

**Benchmarks**:
- Elite: 95+ (Apple: 97, Costco: 96)
- Strong: 85-94 (Netflix: 95 → 89 after multiple increases)
- Emerging: 70-84
- Weak: <70 (Most brands: 50-65)

#### DIMENSION 6 SCORE CALCULATION:

```
Value Creation Score (0-100) = (
    (Tribal LTV Multiplier × 15) × 0.5 +
    (TPW ÷ 2) × 0.3 +
    PII × 0.2
)
```

**TSS Contribution**: Value Creation Score × 0.10

### DIMENSION 7: Tribal Rituals Participation (5% of TSS)

**What It Measures**: Do members engage in tribal rituals?

#### Metric 7.1: Ritual Participation Rate (RPR)

**Formula**:
```
RPR = (Members participating in ANY tribal ritual ÷ Total members) × 100
```

**Tribal Rituals Examples**:
- **Apple**: Midnight launch lines, WWDC viewing parties, unboxing videos
- **CrossFit**: Daily WOD, "Murph" on Memorial Day, Open competition
- **Harley**: Annual rallies (Sturgis, Daytona), group rides, poker runs

- Strong: 40-59% (Apple WWDC watch parties: 48%)
- Emerging: 20-39% (Starbucks PSL first week: 31%)
- Weak: <20% (Most brands have no rituals)

#### Metric 7.2: Ritual Frequency Score (RFS)

**What It Measures**: How often do rituals occur?

**Frequency Points**:
- Daily rituals: 30 points
- Weekly: 15 points
- Monthly: 5 points
- Quarterly: 2 points
- Annual: 1 point

**Formula**:
```
RFS = Sum of (Ritual frequency points × Participation rate)
```

**Example (CrossFit)**:
```
Daily WOD: 30 points × 58% participation = 17.4

## 🧮 COMPLETE TSS CALCULATION: Step-by-Step Example

### Case Study: Calculating TSS for Peloton

**Step 1: Dimension Scores**

**D1: Engagement Intensity**
- EDI: 7.4 → (7.4 × 10) × 0.4 = 29.6
- APR: 42% × 0.4 = 16.8
- MCER: 28% × 0.2 = 5.6
- **Engagement Score**: 29.6 + 16.8 + 5.6 = **52.0**

**D2: Advocacy & Evangelism**
- Tribal NPS: 68 × 0.4 = 27.2
- Referral Rate: 22% × 2 × 0.3 = 13.2
- UAI: 5.2 × 8 × 0.2 = 8.32
- DRR: 31% × 0.1 = 3.1
- **Advocacy Score**: 27.2 + 13.2 + 8.32 + 3.1 = **51.82**

**D3: Identity Adoption**
- TLUR: 31% × 0.3 = 9.3
- SDR: 28.7 × 0.4 = 11.48
- IAS: 54 × 0.3 = 16.2
- **Identity Score**: 9.3 + 11.48 + 16.2 = **36.98**

**D4: Community Cohesion**
- MMIR: 1.9 × 20 × 0.3 = 11.4
- UOER: 14.2 × 2 × 0.2 = 5.68
- TND: 2.1% × 10 × 0.2 = 0.42
- TSER: 37.2 × 0.3 = 11.16
- **Cohesion Score**: 11.4 + 5.68 + 0.42 + 11.16 = **28.66**

**D5: Retention & Longevity**
- TRR: 58.6 × 0.5 = 29.3
- Tenure Health: 72 × 0.3 = 21.6
- IET: (43 + 100) ÷ 2 × 0.2 = 14.3
- **Retention Score**: 29.3 + 21.6 + 14.3 = **65.2**

**D6: Value Creation**
- LTV Multiplier: 2.1x × 15 × 0.5 = 15.75
- TPW: 26% ÷ 2 × 0.3 = 3.9
- PII: 88 × 0.2 = 17.6
- **Value Score**: 15.75 + 3.9 + 17.6 = **37.25**

**D7: Rituals**
- RPR: 38% × 0.6 = 22.8
- RFS: 15.7 × 2 × 0.4 = 12.56
- **Rituals Score**: 22.8 + 12.56 = **35.36**

**Step 2: Apply TSS Weights**

```
TSS = (
    Engagement (52.0) × 0.20 +
    Advocacy (51.82) × 0.20 +
    Identity (36.98) × 0.15 +
    Cohesion (28.66) × 0.15 +
    Retention (65.2) × 0.15 +
    Value (37.25) × 0.10 +
    Rituals (35.36) × 0.05
)

TSS = 10.4 + 10.36 + 5.55 + 4.30 + 9.78 + 3.73 + 1.77
TSS = 45.89
```

**Peloton TSS: 45.89** (Weak-to-Emerging Tribe)

**Interpretation**:
- **Strengths**: High engagement (52), Good retention (65.2)
- **Weaknesses**: Low cohesion (28.66), Weak identity (36.98)
- **Status**: Has tribal POTENTIAL but not yet strong tribe
- **Priority**: Improve community cohesion and tribal identity markers
