## 🎯 PRE-ACTIVATION: Before You Start (Week -1)

### Tribal Readiness Assessment

**Answer These Questions Honestly:**

**1. Product-Market Fit**
- [ ] Do customers use our product 3+ times per week? (High frequency required)
- [ ] Do customers stay 12+ months? (Can't build tribe with churning customers)
- [ ] Do customers achieve meaningful outcomes? (Tribal pride needs wins)
- [ ] Would customers be disappointed if we disappeared? (Emotional connection exists)

**If <3 checkmarks** → Fix product-market fit FIRST, then build tribe

**2. Tribal Differentiation**
- [ ] Can we articulate a clear identity? ("We are ___" in 5 words)
- [ ] Do we have a meaningful shared belief? (Beyond "quality products")
- [ ] Is there a clear "other"? (What/who are we NOT?)
- [ ] Do power users already self-identify? (Early tribal signals)

**If <2 checkmarks** → Define tribal identity FIRST (use Tribal Identity Worksheet)

**3. Resource Commitment**
- [ ] Can we dedicate 1 FTE to tribal activation? (Community manager minimum)
- [ ] Do we have $10K-50K for 90-day budget? (Content, events, tools)
- [ ] Will leadership support for full 90 days? (No quitting at day 30)
- [ ] Can we respond to community daily? (Tribal = real-time engagement)

**If <3 checkmarks** → Secure resources FIRST, then launch

**4. Measurement Capability**
- [ ] Can we track engagement metrics? (Who's active, how often)
- [ ] Can we identify power users? (Top 10%, super fans)
- [ ] Can we measure referrals? (Who recruited whom)
- [ ] Can we monitor social sentiment? (Mentions, brand perception)

**If <2 checkmarks** → Set up tracking FIRST (use Tribal Measurement Framework)

### Decision Point

**✅ READY TO PROCEED if:**
- Product-market fit: 3+ checkmarks
- Tribal differentiation: 2+ checkmarks
- Resource commitment: 3+ checkmarks
- Measurement: 2+ checkmarks

**⚠️ NOT READY if any category below threshold**
→ Complete pre-work, then return to this playbook

## 📅 THE 90-DAY TRIBAL ACTIVATION PLAN

### PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Days 1-30) - "Seed the Tribe"

**Goal**: Identify and activate your first 100 tribal members (the "Founding 100")

#### Week 1 (Days 1-7): Identify Your Tribal Core

**Day 1-2: Data Mining for Power Users**

**Action**: Pull customer data, score by tribal potential

**Tribal Potential Score Formula**:
```
TPS = (
    Tenure (months) × 2 +
    Engagement frequency (per month) × 3 +
    Referrals made × 10 +
    Social mentions × 5 +
    Support interactions (positive) × 2
)
```

**Target**: Top 500 customers by TPS (your "Tribal Candidates")

**Tool**: Export to spreadsheet, sort by TPS descending

**Example**:
```
Customer A:
- Tenure: 24 months × 2 = 48
- Engagement: 15/month × 3 = 45
- Referrals: 2 × 10 = 20
- Social mentions: 3 × 5 = 15
- Support: 8 positive × 2 = 16
TPS = 48 + 45 + 20 + 15 + 16 = 144 (HIGH - Priority outreach!)

Customer B:
- Tenure: 6 months × 2 = 12
- Engagement: 3/month × 3 = 9
- Referrals: 0 × 10 = 0
- Social mentions: 0 × 5 = 0
- Support: 1 × 2 = 2
TPS = 12 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 23 (LOW - Not yet tribal)
```

**Deliverable**: List of top 500 tribal candidates with TPS scores

---

**Day 3-4: Personal Outreach to Top 50**

**Action**: Founder/CEO personally emails top 50 customers

**Email Template**:
```
Subject: I need your help building something special

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], [founder/CEO] of [Brand]. I'm reaching out personally
because you're one of our most valued customers.

I've noticed you've been with us for [X months], you use [Product] [X
times per week], and you even referred [X friends]. That means the world
to us.

Here's why I'm writing: We're building something new. Not a product - a
COMMUNITY. A place for people like you who believe [core belief] and want
[shared goal].

I'm personally inviting 50 customers to help shape this from the ground up.
You'd be a "Founding Member" - helping decide what this community becomes.

Interested? Reply with "I'm in" and I'll send details tomorrow.

Thanks for being part of our journey,
[Your Name]
[Founder/CEO, Brand]

P.S. If you're not interested, no worries! You'll always be a valued
customer regardless.
```

**Success Metric**: 40%+ response rate (20+ interested from top 50)

**Why Founder/CEO**: Signals importance, not automated marketing

---

**Day 5-7: Launch "Founding 100" Invitation Campaign**

**Action**: Invite next 200 tribal candidates (after personal top 50)

**Invitation Email** (slightly different from founder email):
```
Subject: Founding Member Invitation (Limited to 100)

Hi [Name],

We're launching the [Brand] Tribe - a community for [core identity] who
believe [core belief].

You're invited to be one of the FOUNDING 100 MEMBERS.

What does that mean?
✓ Exclusive Founding Member badge (forever)
✓ Early access to new features/products
✓ Direct line to our team
✓ Shape community direction
✓ Connect with other [tribe members]

We're capping this at 100 people. Once full, there's a waitlist.

Interested? Click here to claim your spot: [Link to simple form]

Looking forward to building this together,
[Community Manager Name]

P.S. Spots filling fast - 42/100 claimed in first 48 hours.
```

**Scarcity Element**: "Limited to 100" (creates urgency + exclusivity)

**Form Questions**:
1. Name
2. Email
3. Why do you want to join? (Tribal belief alignment check)
4. What would make this community valuable to you? (Co-creation input)

**Success Metric**: 100 members signed up within 7 days

**Actual Reality**: You'll likely get 60-80 from 250 invites
- **If <60**: Expand to top 400, adjust messaging
- **If 100+**: Great! Keep accepting to 150 (attrition buffer)

---

#### Week 2 (Days 8-14): Build Tribal Infrastructure

**Day 8-9: Choose Community Platform**

- ❌ Expensive ($50K-200K build)
- ❌ Maintenance overhead

**Decision Framework**:
- Budget <$500: Discord or Facebook Group

- Budget $50K+: Custom platform

**For This Playbook**: We'll use **Circle** (professional, scalable, reasonable cost)

**Action**: Set up Circle community (1-2 hours)

#### Week 7 (Days 45-51): Tribal Boundaries & Shared Enemy

**Day 45-47: Define "Us vs. Them" (Carefully!)**

**Purpose**: Clarify who the tribe IS by defining who it ISN'T

**⚠️ WARNING**: This is HIGH-RISK. Do it wrong = alienate people. Do it right = galvanize tribe.

**Safe Approach**: Define enemy as IDEA/BEHAVIOR, not PEOPLE

**Examples**:

**❌ WRONG** (Attacks people):
- "We're not like those lazy people who..."
- "Unlike [Competitor] customers who are..."
- "For people who aren't [demographic]..."

**✅ RIGHT** (Attacks ideas/behaviors):
- "We believe [value], not [opposite value]"
- "We're for people who prioritize [goal] over [alternative]"
- "We reject [behavior], we embrace [better behavior]"

**Template**:
```
# What We Stand For (And What We Don't)

At [Brand], we're building a tribe of [identity] who believe [core belief].

WE BELIEVE:
• [Positive value #1] (not [opposite])
• [Positive value #2] (not [opposite])
• [Positive value #3] (not [opposite])

WE'RE FOR PEOPLE WHO:
✓ [Positive characteristic]
✓ [Positive characteristic]
✓ [Positive characteristic]

WE'RE NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO:
✗ [Incompatible value - framed neutrally]
✗ [Incompatible behavior - non-judgmental]
✗ [Deal-breaker belief - stated as preference]

IMPORTANT: There's no "right" or "wrong" - just different values. We
respect people with different priorities; we just know we're not the
right fit for each other. And that's okay!

If you DO share our values? Welcome home. You're in the right place.
```

**Example (Patagonia)**:
```
WE BELIEVE:
• Quality over quantity (not fast fashion disposability)
• Planet over profit (not extractive capitalism)
• Repair over replace (not planned obsolescence)

WE'RE NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO:
✗ Want the cheapest option at any cost
✗ Don't care about environmental impact
✗ Prefer trendy over timeless

And that's fine! There are great brands for those preferences. We're just
not one of them.
```

**Why This Works**:
- States values clearly (self-selection)
- Non-judgmental tone (respectful)
- Gives permission to NOT join (reduces poor fits)
- Strengthens tribal identity for those who DO align

**Success Metric**:
- 70%+ of members comment: "This is exactly why I'm here!"
- 5-10% self-select out (good! Wrong fit anyway)
- Clarity on tribal identity score +20%
