## Part 1: Tribal Identity Definition

### Step 1: Define "Who We Are"

**Brainstorm session (60 minutes):**

```
Question 1: What values do we stand for?
(List 5-7 core values)

1. _____________________________________
2. _____________________________________
3. _____________________________________
4. _____________________________________
5. _____________________________________
6. _____________________________________
7. _____________________________________

Pick top 3 (these become tribal pillars):
⭐ 1. _____________________________________
⭐ 2. _____________________________________
⭐ 3. _____________________________________
```

---

```
Question 2: What type of people are we?
(Character traits, identities, demographics)

We are:
- __________________ (identity: creators, rebels, athletes, etc.)
- __________________ (trait: curious, ambitious, conscious)
- __________________ (behavior: we _____, not _____)

Complete this sentence:
"We're the kind of people who _____________________________________"

Example:
"We're the kind of people who climb mountains, not sit on couches."
(Patagonia-style)
```

---

```
Question 3: What do we believe that others don't?
(Contrarian belief, tribal dogma)

We believe:
_____________________________________________________________________

Most people believe:
_____________________________________________________________________

Why we're right:
_____________________________________________________________________

Example:
We believe: "Failure is data, not defeat"
Most people believe: "Failure is bad"
Why we're right: "Iteration leads to innovation"
```

---

### Step 2: Define "Who We're NOT"

**Contrast mapping:**

```
US vs. THEM matrix:

┌────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┐
│ US (Our Tribe)         │ THEM (Out-Group)       │
├────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┤
│ Value: ___________     │ Value: ___________     │
│ Behavior: _________    │ Behavior: _________    │
│ Identity: __________   │ Identity: __________   │
│ Language: _________    │ Language: _________    │
│ Style: ____________    │ Style: ____________    │
└────────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘

Example (CrossFit):
┌────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┐
│ US                     │ THEM                   │
├────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┤
│ Value: Intensity       │ Value: Comfort         │
│ Behavior: Push limits  │ Behavior: Cruise       │
│ Identity: Athletes     │ Identity: Gym-goers    │
│ Language: WOD, Box     │ Language: Workout, Gym │
│ Style: Functional      │ Style: Machines        │
└────────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘
```

**Enemy identification:**

```
Our tribe unites AGAINST:
(Pick 1-2, be specific)

☐ Competitor brand: _____________________________________
☐ Industry problem: _____________________________________
☐ Cultural norm: ________________________________________
☐ Shared frustration: ___________________________________

Why this enemy? (Strategic reasoning)
_____________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________

Example:
Enemy: "Overpriced razors from monopoly brands"
Why: Dollar Shave Club positioning (we're the affordable rebel alternative)
```

---

### Step 3: Create Tribal Manifesto

**Template:**

```
[BRAND NAME] MANIFESTO

We are [identity].

We believe [core belief that defines us].

We value [value 1], [value 2], and [value 3].

We're not [out-group identity]. We don't [out-group behavior].

We're here to [mission/purpose].

Join us if you believe [call to belief].

Together, we [collective action/goal].

Example (Patagonia-style):

PATAGONIA MANIFESTO

Join us if you believe in fighting for what we love.

Together, we repair, reuse, and revolt against mindless consumption.

Welcome to the tribe.
```

## Part 7: Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem #1: Low Engagement

**Symptoms:**
- Community exists but members don't participate
- Few posts, comments, or interactions

**Diagnosis:**

```
[ ] No clear rituals (members don't know when/how to participate)
[ ] No value (community doesn't provide benefit)
[ ] No seeding (no initial content to respond to)
[ ] No moderation (spam, negativity drives away members)
```

**Solutions:**

```
✅ Create weekly ritual (predictable participation opportunity)
✅ Seed content (ask questions, start discussions)
✅ Spotlight members (feature their stories, incentivize sharing)
✅ Gamify (points, badges, leaderboards for participation)
✅ Host events (virtual or in-person gatherings)
```

---

### Problem #2: Wrong Members Joining

**Symptoms:**
- Community members don't align with tribal values
- Negative culture developing

**Diagnosis:**

```
[ ] Identity not clear (anyone can join, no filter)
[ ] No initiation (no trial period or commitment)
[ ] No moderation (bad actors not removed)
```

**Solutions:**

```
✅ Make manifesto prominent (self-selection filter)
✅ Add initiation ritual (slight barrier to entry)
✅ Moderate actively (remove toxic members quickly)
✅ Highlight tribal members (model desired behavior)
✅ Invite-only periods (control growth quality)
```

---

### Problem #3: Tribal Fatigue

**Symptoms:**
- Early members less engaged over time
- Rituals feel stale

**Diagnosis:**

```
[ ] No evolution (tribe stagnant, boring)
[ ] No new challenges (members "graduated")
[ ] No status progression (nowhere to grow)
```

**Solutions:**

```
✅ Introduce new rituals (keep fresh)
✅ Create advanced tiers (elite status for veterans)
✅ Give veterans leadership roles (community moderators)
✅ Host special events (re-ignite excitement)
✅ Expand mission (new shared goals)
```
