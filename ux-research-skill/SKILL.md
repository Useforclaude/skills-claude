├─ User feedback
└─ Post-launch usability testing
```

---

# Part 2: Qualitative Research Methods

## 2.1 User Interviews

**Types:**
```
Structured       Fixed questions (like survey)
Semi-structured  Flexible (ask follow-ups)
Unstructured     Open conversation

Best: Semi-structured (balance flexibility + consistency)
```

**Planning:**
```
1. Define goals (what do you want to learn?)
2. Recruit participants (5-10 per segment)
3. Write discussion guide (questions)
4. Schedule sessions (60 min each)
5. Prepare tools (Zoom, recording, notes)
```

**Discussion Guide Example:**
```
1. Introduction (5 min)
   - Thank participant
   - Explain purpose
   - Get consent to record

2. Background (10 min)
   - "Tell me about your role..."
   - "How often do you [task]?"

3. Current Behavior (20 min)
   - "Walk me through how you [task] today"
   - "What tools do you use?"
   - "What frustrates you?"

4. Needs & Pain Points (15 min)
   - "What would make [task] easier?"
   - "If you had a magic wand..."

5. Wrap-up (10 min)
   - "Anything else to add?"
   - Thank & compensate
```

**Best Practices:**
```
✅ Do:
- Ask open-ended questions ("How do you...?")
- Follow up ("Tell me more about that")
- Embrace silence (let them think)
- Record session (with permission)

❌ Don't:
- Ask leading questions ("Don't you think...?")
- Interview friends/family (biased)
- Ask what they want (ask what they do)
- Talk too much (80/20 rule: them talk 80%)
```

---

## 2.2 Usability Testing

**What is Usability Testing?**
- Watch users complete tasks with your product
- Identify where they struggle

**Types:**
```
Moderated (with facilitator)
├─ In-person
└─ Remote (Zoom)

Unmoderated (self-guided)
├─ UserTesting.com
├─ Maze
└─ Lookback
```

**Process:**
```
1. Define tasks (3-5 tasks)
   "Find a blue shirt in size M and add to cart"

2. Recruit participants (5-8 users)
   Nielsen: 5 users find 85% of usability issues

3. Run sessions (30-45 min)
   - Give task, don't help
   - Ask "think aloud" (verbalize thoughts)
   - Observe struggles

4. Analyze findings
   - Where did users get stuck?
   - What confused them?
   - Success rate per task?

5. Report & prioritize fixes
```

**Think Aloud Protocol:**
```
Facilitator: "Please think aloud as you work"

User: "Hmm, I'm looking for the search... 
       Oh, here it is, top-right. 
       I'll type 'blue shirt'...
       Wait, why are there only 2 results? 
       I expected more..."

→ Reveals mental model, expectations, confusion!
```

**Metrics to Track:**
```
Task success rate:      80%+ is good
Time on task:           Compare to baseline
Error rate:             # mistakes per task
Satisfaction (SUS):     System Usability Scale (0-100)
```

---

## 2.3 Field Studies (Contextual Inquiry)

**What?**
- Observe users in their natural environment
- See actual behavior (not self-reported)

**Example:**
```
Research goal: Improve hospital nurse software

Don't: Interview nurses in conference room
Do: Shadow nurses during shift

Observations:
- Nurses interrupted every 5 min
- Use software while walking
- Need quick access, not complex menus

Insight: Design for mobile, minimal taps
```

---

## 2.4 Card Sorting (Information Architecture)

**What?**
- Users organize content into categories
- Reveals mental models

**Types:**
```
Open Card Sort
├─ Users create category names
└─ Discovers unexpected groupings

Closed Card Sort
├─ You provide category names
└─ Tests if categories make sense
```

**Process:**
```
1. Create cards (one per content item)
   Example: "User Profile", "Settings", "Billing", "Support"

2. Ask users to group cards
   "Group these into categories that make sense to you"

3. Analyze patterns
   - Which items grouped together?
   - What category names used?

4. Design navigation based on results
```

**Tools:**
```
OptimalSort (online)
Maze
UserZoom
In-person: Physical cards
```

---

# Part 3: Quantitative Research Methods

## 3.1 Surveys

**When to Use:**
- Collect feedback from many users (100+)
- Measure satisfaction, preferences
- Validate qualitative findings

**Question Types:**
```
Multiple Choice
├─ "How often do you use our app?"
    □ Daily □ Weekly □ Monthly □ Rarely

Rating Scale (Likert)
├─ "How satisfied are you with checkout?"
    1 (Very dissatisfied) → 5 (Very satisfied)

Open-Ended
├─ "What would improve your experience?"
    [Text box]
```

**Best Practices:**
```
✅ Do:
- Keep short (5-10 min max)
- One question at a time
- Use simple language
- Include progress bar
- Offer incentive ($10 gift card)

❌ Don't:
- Leading questions ("Don't you love our app?")
- Double-barreled ("Is the app fast and easy?")
- Too many open-ended questions (users skip)
```

**Survey Tools:**
```
Google Forms (free)
Typeform (beautiful)
SurveyMonkey
Qualtrics (enterprise)
```

---

## 3.2 A/B Testing

**What?**
- Show variant A to 50% users, variant B to 50%
- Measure which performs better

**Example:**
```
Hypothesis: Green CTA button will increase clicks

A (Control):    Blue button "Sign Up"
B (Variant):    Green button "Sign Up"

Run test for 2 weeks:
- A: 10% click rate
- B: 12% click rate

Result: B wins! Green button is +20% better
```

**What to Test:**
```
Headlines:        "Get Started" vs "Try Free"
CTA buttons:      Color, size, text
Page layout:      Order of sections
Pricing:          $9/mo vs $99/year
Images:           Product photo vs lifestyle photo
```

**Sample Size Calculator:**
```
Need ~1,000 visitors per variant minimum
Use: https://abtestguide.com/calc/

Example:
- Baseline conversion: 5%
- Minimum detectable effect: 20% increase (5% → 6%)
- Required sample: 8,000 visitors per variant
```

**Tools:**
```
Google Optimize (free, sunsetted 2023 → use GA4)
Optimizely (enterprise)
VWO
Statsig
```

---

## 3.3 Analytics (Behavioral Data)

**Key Metrics:**
```
Traffic Metrics:
├─ Sessions:           # visits
├─ Users:              # unique visitors
├─ Pageviews:          # page loads
└─ Bounce rate:        % leave after 1 page

Engagement Metrics:
├─ Time on page:       How long users stay
├─ Pages per session:  How many pages viewed
└─ Scroll depth:       How far users scroll

Conversion Metrics:
├─ Conversion rate:    % who complete goal
├─ Goal completions:   # signups, purchases
└─ Funnel drop-off:    Where users abandon
```

**Google Analytics 4:**
```
Events to track:
├─ Button clicks:      "CTA_Click", "Add_to_Cart"
├─ Form submissions:   "Form_Submit", "Signup_Complete"
├─ Video plays:        "Video_Start", "Video_Complete"
└─ Scroll depth:       25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
```

**Heatmaps (Hotjar, Crazy Egg):**
```
Click Heatmap:         Where users click most
Scroll Heatmap:        How far users scroll
Move Heatmap:          Where users move mouse

Insight: If CTA below fold and 60% don't scroll → Move CTA up!
```

# Part 4: User Personas & Journey Maps

## 4.1 User Personas

**What?**
- Fictional character representing user segment
- Based on research data (not assumptions!)

**Persona Template:**
```
Name: Sarah the Busy Mom

Demographics:
├─ Age: 35
├─ Location: Suburban Chicago
├─ Occupation: Marketing Manager
├─ Family: Married, 2 kids (5, 8 years old)
└─ Tech savvy: Medium

Goals:
├─ Order groceries quickly (30 min max)
├─ Find healthy meals for family
└─ Stay under $200/week budget

Pain Points:
├─ No time to visit physical store
├─ Previous app had confusing checkout
└─ Wants personalized recommendations

Behaviors:
├─ Shops online 2× per week
├─ Uses mobile app (not desktop)
├─ Prefers saved lists (repeat orders)
└─ Price-conscious but values quality

Quote: "I just want to get groceries done quickly 
        so I can focus on my kids"
```

**How to Create:**
```
1. Conduct user research (interviews, surveys)
2. Identify patterns (common goals, behaviors)
3. Segment users (e.g., Budget Shopper vs Premium Shopper)
4. Create 2-4 personas (not 20!)
5. Validate with team (does this feel real?)
```

**Use Personas For:**
```
✅ Design decisions ("Would Sarah understand this?")
✅ Prioritization ("Does this solve Sarah's pain point?")
✅ Team alignment (shared understanding of users)

❌ Not for:
- Stereotyping users
- Making up data (always research-based!)
```

---

## 4.2 Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

**Framework:**
```
When [situation],
I want to [motivation],
So I can [expected outcome].

Example:
"When I'm hungry at work,
 I want to order lunch quickly,
 So I can get back to my meeting in 15 min."
```

**Better than:**
```
Traditional: "Millennials want fast food"
JTBD: "Busy professionals need lunch in < 15 min"

→ Focuses on context + motivation, not demographics!
```

---

## 4.3 User Journey Map

**What?**
- Visual story of user experience over time
- Shows pain points, emotions, touchpoints

**Journey Map Structure:**
```
Persona: Sarah the Busy Mom
Scenario: Ordering groceries online

Stages:
├─ 1. Awareness (discovers app)
├─ 2. Consideration (downloads, explores)
├─ 3. First purchase (creates account, orders)
├─ 4. Ongoing use (reorders weekly)
└─ 5. Advocacy (recommends to friends)

For each stage:
├─ Actions (what user does)
├─ Touchpoints (where they interact)
├─ Emotions (happy, frustrated, confused)
├─ Pain points (struggles)
└─ Opportunities (improvements)
```

**Example Stage:**
```
Stage 3: First Purchase

Actions:
1. Opens app
2. Creates account
3. Browses products
4. Adds items to cart
5. Checks out
6. Receives confirmation

Emotions:
1. 😊 Excited (new app!)
2. 😐 Neutral (signup okay)
3. 🤔 Confused (can't find organic section)
4. 😊 Happy (found what I need)
5. 😡 Frustrated (checkout has 5 steps!)
6. 😌 Relieved (order placed)

Pain Points:
- Hard to find organic products
- Checkout too long (5 steps)
- No saved payment method

Opportunities:
- Add "Organic" filter
- One-page checkout
- Save payment for next time
```

---

# Part 5: Research Analysis & Synthesis

## 5.1 Affinity Mapping

**What?**
- Organize research findings into themes
- Bottom-up pattern recognition

**Process:**
```
1. Write observations on sticky notes (one per note)
   - "User couldn't find search button"
   - "User expected back button top-left"
   - "User abandoned after seeing price"

2. Group similar notes together
   Theme: Navigation Issues
   ├─ Couldn't find search
   ├─ Expected back button
   └─ Confused by menu structure

3. Name themes
   - Navigation Issues
   - Pricing Concerns
   - Performance Problems

4. Prioritize themes (which impact most users?)
```

**Tools:**
```
Physical: Sticky notes on wall
Digital: Miro, Mural, FigJam
```

---

## 5.2 Research Insights (not findings!)

**Finding vs Insight:**
```
Finding: Observation (what happened)
Insight: Interpretation (why it matters + what to do)

❌ Finding only:
"5 out of 8 users clicked the wrong button"

✅ Insight:
"Users expect 'Next' button on bottom-right (mental model from other apps).
 Our button is top-left, causing confusion.
 → Move 'Next' button to bottom-right, increase size to 44×44pt."
```

**Insight Template:**
```
Observation: [What we saw]
Impact: [Why it matters]
Recommendation: [What to do]

Example:
Observation: 60% of mobile users abandon cart at checkout
Impact: Losing $50K revenue/month
Recommendation: Implement Apple Pay / Google Pay for 1-tap checkout
Expected result: Reduce abandonment by 30% (+$15K/month)
```

---

## 5.3 Research Report Structure

**Executive Summary (1 page):**
```
- Goals of research
- Methods used
- Key insights (top 3-5)
- Recommendations (prioritized)
```

**Methodology:**
```
- Participants (who, how many)
- Methods (interviews, testing, etc.)
- Timeline (when conducted)
```

**Findings:**
```
For each finding:
├─ Quote from participant
├─ Screenshot/video clip
├─ Supporting data (% of users)
└─ Recommendation
```

**Prioritization Matrix:**
```
High Impact + Easy → Do first!
High Impact + Hard → Plan for later
Low Impact + Easy → Nice to have
Low Impact + Hard → Don't do
```
