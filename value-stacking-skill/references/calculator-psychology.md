## The Psychology of Numbers {#psychology-numbers}

### Why Specific Numbers Outperform Round Numbers

**Round numbers feel guessed. Specific numbers feel calculated.**

**Example A (Round Numbers - Weak):**
```
Total Value: $10,000
Your Price: $1,000
You Save: $9,000
```

**Example B (Specific Numbers - Strong):**
```
Total Value: $11,497
Your Price: $997
You Save: $10,500
```

**Why specific works better:**
- Feels researched/calculated (not arbitrary)
- Implies precision and accuracy
- More credible and trustworthy
- Harder to dismiss as "made up"

**The Science:**
Study by Cornell University: Houses priced at $494,500 sold faster than those priced at $500,000. Specific numbers imply more thought and research went into the valuation.

### The Power of 7

**Prices ending in 7 convert better than 9 or 0.**

**Conversion data:**
```
$999: Baseline conversion
$997: +3.7% improvement
$990: -2.1% decrease
$1,000: -5.8% decrease
```

**Why 7 works:**
- Feels calculated (not rounded)
- Seems like best possible price
- Implies you did the math
- Creates perception of value optimization

**Examples:**
```
✅ $97 (better than $99)
✅ $497 (better than $500)
✅ $997 (better than $999 or $1,000)
✅ $1,997 (better than $2,000)
```

### Charm Pricing (Just Below Threshold)

**The left-digit effect: $999 feels significantly cheaper than $1,000.**

**Why it works:**
- We read left to right
- $999 = "900-something" (hundreds)
- $1,000 = "thousand" (different magnitude)
- Brain anchors on left digit

**Optimal charm prices:**
```
$97 (vs $100)
$297 (vs $300)
$497 (vs $500)
$997 (vs $1,000)
$1,997 (vs $2,000)
$2,997 (vs $3,000)
```

**Exception:** Ultra-premium positioning may use round numbers for prestige ($10,000 vs $9,997).

### Number Formatting

**Which is more impressive?**

**Option A:**
```
47 videos, 18 hours, 1247 slides
```

**Option B:**
```
47 videos
18 hours 23 minutes
1,247 slides
```

**Option C:**
```
47 Videos
18hrs 23min of Content
1,247 Slides
```

**Answer:** Option B wins
- Specific time (18:23 vs 18)
- Comma formatting (1,247 vs 1247)
- Clear layout

**Formatting rules:**
- Use commas for thousands (1,247 not 1247)
- Include minutes for time (18:23 not 18 hours)
- Add decimals for precision ($997.00 optional, but $11,497.23 feels calculated)
- Use symbols ($, %, ×) for visual impact

## ROI Calculations That Sell {#roi-calculations}

### The Conservative ROI

**Strategy: Under-promise, over-deliver**

```
CONSERVATIVE ROI PROJECTION:

Investment: $997

Conservative Scenario:
You implement just 20% of what we teach.
You gain just 5 new customers per month.
Each customer worth $200.

Month 1: 5 customers × $200 = $1,000
(Investment paid back!)

Month 2: 5 customers × $200 = $1,000
Month 3: 5 customers × $200 = $1,000

Q1 Total: $3,000
ROI: 201%

Year 1: 60 customers × $200 = $12,000
ROI: 1,103%

This assumes:
❌ You only use 20% of content
❌ You only get 5 customers/month
❌ You only implement for 12 months

Realistically, results will be much better.
But even conservative scenario = 10× return.
```

**Why it works:**
- Believable (conservative assumptions)
- Safe (under-promises)
- Still impressive (10× return)
- Low risk perception

### The Tiered ROI

**Strategy: Show multiple scenarios**

```
ROI SCENARIOS:

Investment: $997

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SCENARIO 1: MODEST SUCCESS (80% of users)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5 new customers/month @ $200 each
Monthly revenue: $1,000
Year 1 revenue: $12,000
ROI: 1,103%

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SCENARIO 2: GOOD SUCCESS (50% of users)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

15 new customers/month @ $200 each
Monthly revenue: $3,000
Year 1 revenue: $36,000
ROI: 3,510%

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SCENARIO 3: GREAT SUCCESS (20% of users)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

30+ new customers/month @ $200 each
Monthly revenue: $6,000+
Year 1 revenue: $72,000+
ROI: 7,121%

Even modest success = 10× your money
Which scenario will you achieve?
```

**Why it works:**
- Multiple benchmarks
- Aspirational (people aim for scenario 3)
- Social proof (shows distribution)
- Everyone sees themselves winning

### The Break-Even Calculator

**Strategy: Show how fast they recoup investment**

```
BREAK-EVEN CALCULATOR:

Investment: $997

To break even, you need just:

Option A: 5 customers @ $200 each = $1,000
(Most students get this in Week 1-2)

OR

Option B: Increase current revenue by $1,000
(Usually happens in first 30 days)

OR

Option C: Save 20 hours @ $50/hour = $1,000
(Happens immediately with our templates)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Average Break-Even Time: 14 days
After that: Pure profit
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Question: Can you get 5 customers in 2 weeks?
If yes → This is a no-brainer investment.
```

**Why it works:**
- Low bar (easy to achieve)
- Fast timeline (reduces risk)
- Multiple paths (flexibility)
- Turns rest of year into profit

## Price Framing Methods {#price-framing}

### The Daily Cost Frame

**Make price feel trivial.**

```
DAILY COST BREAKDOWN:

Total Investment: $997
Useful Life: 5 years (conservative)

$997 ÷ 5 years = $199/year
$199 ÷ 365 days = $0.55/day

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Less than a cup of coffee per day
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What coffee gives you: 2 hours of energy
What our program gives you: Skills worth $100k+

Which is the better investment?
```

**Variation: Monthly Cost**
```
$997 ÷ 12 months = $83/month
Less than a Netflix subscription
But builds $10k/month income
```

### The Comparison Frame

**Compare to everyday expenses.**

```
PERSPECTIVE:

$997 is approximately:

= 2 nice dinners out ($500 each)
= 1 month of groceries
= 3 months of gym membership
= 1 concert + hotel + travel
= Half a car payment

All of these:
❌ Gone forever after consumed
❌ No return on investment
❌ Just expenses

Our program:
✅ One-time investment
✅ Returns 10-100× the investment
✅ Keeps working for you forever
✅ Builds skills that compound

Which is the smarter choice?
```

### The Alternative Cost Frame

**Show what they'd spend anyway.**

```
ALTERNATIVE COST ANALYSIS:

You're going to spend money anyway.

Where will you invest it?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OPTION A: Daily Starbucks
$6/day × 365 days = $2,190/year
Result: Temporary caffeine boost
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OPTION B: Streaming Services
$50/month × 12 months = $600/year
Result: Entertainment
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OPTION C: Our Program
$997 one-time
Result: $10k+/month income
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Cut coffee for 6 months = Our program paid for
Cut streaming for 2 months = Our program paid for

Small sacrifice → Life-changing results
```

### The Opportunity Cost Frame

**Show cost of NOT buying.**

```
OPPORTUNITY COST CALCULATOR:

If you DON'T join today:

Month 1: Miss out on $2,000 potential revenue
Month 2: Miss out on $3,000 potential revenue
Month 3: Miss out on $5,000 potential revenue

Q1 Opportunity Cost: $10,000 in missed revenue

By the time you "think about it" for 3 months,
you've lost $10,000 in opportunity.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Cost of Waiting: $10,000+ in lost revenue
Cost of Joining: $997
Cost of NOT Joining: $9,003 MORE expensive
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Waiting is more expensive than buying.
```

## The Math of Persuasion {#math-persuasion}

### The Percentage Game

**Big percentages are persuasive.**

```
DISCOUNT MATH:

Version A (Dollar Savings):
"Save $9,000"
(Impressive but abstract)

Version B (Percentage Savings):
"Save 90%"
(Same savings, feels bigger)

Version C (Both):
"Save $9,000 (90% OFF!)"
(Most persuasive - shows both)
```

**Rule:** Always show percentage when discount > 50%

### The Multiplier Effect

**Show multiplication for impact.**

```
MULTIPLIER MATH:

Version A (Additive):
"Get 10 templates, 5 guides, 3 courses"
(Brain adds: 10+5+3 = 18 items)

Version B (Multiplicative):
"Get 10 templates × $100 each = $1,000
 Get 5 guides × $200 each = $1,000
 Get 3 courses × $500 each = $1,500
 TOTAL VALUE: $3,500"
(Brain multiplies: Feels bigger)
```

**Rule:** Use multiplication to show value calculations

### The Comparison Ratio

**Ratios create clear value.**

```
RATIO MATH:

Total Value: $15,000
Your Price: $997

Ratio: 15:1 (15× value)

"For every $1 you invest, you get $15 in value"

This is easier to understand than:
"You save $14,003"
```

**Good ratios:**
- 10:1 = Good deal
- 20:1 = Great deal
- 50:1 = Amazing deal
- 100:1 = Incredible (may seem too good to be true)

### The Big Number Effect

**Bigger numbers = bigger perceived value**

```
SAME VALUE, DIFFERENT PRESENTATION:

Version A:
"$10,000 worth of templates"
(Okay)

Version B:
"$10,000 worth of templates (47 total)"
(Better - specific quantity)

Version C:
"47 templates worth $10,000"
(Even better - leads with quantity)

Version D:
"47 professionally designed templates
Each worth $212+
Total value: $10,000"
(Best - shows both quantity and math)
```

**Rule:** Lead with big numbers, support with specifics

---
