**1. Social Currency (Berger's STEPPS Framework)**
People share content that makes them look:
- Smart
- Cool
- In-the-know
- Helpful
- Part of a movement

**2. Emotion Activation**
High-arousal emotions drive sharing:
- ‚úÖ **Positive:** Awe, Excitement, Amusement, Joy
- ‚úÖ **Negative:** Anger, Anxiety, Outrage, Fear
- ‚ùå **Low-arousal:** Sadness, Contentment (less viral)

**3. Practical Value**
Content that is:
- Useful
- Educational
- Money-saving
- Time-saving
- Life-improving

**4. Stories & Narrative**
Human brain wired for stories:
- Character we relate to
- Conflict/problem
- Resolution/transformation
- Moral/lesson

**5. Triggers (Top-of-Mind Awareness)**
Content linked to:
- Daily occurrences
- Common situations
- Trending topics
- Seasonal events

**6. Public Visibility**
Built-in sharing mechanisms:
- Challenges (people tag friends)
- Duets/Stitches (remix culture)
- Reactions (commentary on viral content)
- Trends (participation = visibility)
